# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Project üß†

Welcome to my Neural Networks and Deep Learning course project repository! This project was completed as part of my coursework, and it features six different assignments that cover a variety of topics in the field of deep learning.

## Assignments üìù

Here's a breakdown of the different assignments that are included in this project:

- **CA1: Adaline, Madaline, RBM, and MLP** - This assignment explores the performance of different neural network architectures, including Adaline, Madaline, RBM, and MLP.

- **CA2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** - In this assignment, we implement a CNN for image classification and compare its performance with other algorithms.

- **CA3: Transfer Learning, Segmentation, and YOLOv5** - This assignment focuses on transfer learning and implementing segmentation using YOLOv5.

- **CA4: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), CNN-LSTM** - In this assignment, we dive into the world of RNNs and LSTM architectures, and we combine them with CNNs.

- **CA5: BERT Implementation, BEIT for Image Segmentation and Classification** - This assignment focuses on implementing the BERT model for natural language processing tasks and BEIT for image segmentation and classification.

- **CA6: Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN), Wasserstein GAN** - In this assignment, we explore various GAN architectures, including Deep CGAN, ACGAN, and Wasserstein GAN.
