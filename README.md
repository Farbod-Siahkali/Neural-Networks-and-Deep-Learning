# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Project üß†

Welcome to my [Neural Networks and Deep Learning course](https://dnn-ut.github.io/) project repository! This project was completed as part of my coursework with [Dr. Ahmad Kalhor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m7xdmMgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Tehran, and it features six different assignments that cover a variety of topics in the field of deep learning.


## Assignments üìù

Here's a breakdown of the different assignments that are included in this project, along with two representative images of the same size for each one:

### CA1: Adaline, Madaline, RBM, and MLP

This assignment explores the performance of different neural network architectures, including Adaline, Madaline, RBM, and MLP.

### CA2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

In this assignment, we implement a CNN for image classification and compare its performance with other algorithms.

### CA3: Transfer Learning, Segmentation, and YOLOv5

This assignment focuses on transfer learning and implementing segmentation using YOLOv5.

### CA4: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), CNN-LSTM

In this assignment, we dive into the world of RNNs and LSTM architectures, and we combine them with CNNs.

### CA6: Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN), Wasserstein GAN

In this assignment, we explore various GAN architectures, including Deep CGAN, ACGAN, and Wasserstein GAN.
