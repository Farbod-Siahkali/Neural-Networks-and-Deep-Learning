1914947530,Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO,"Wed 05 Apr 2017 Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO. Victims of a suspected chemical attack in Syria appeared to show symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. ""Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents"" WHO said in a statement putting the death toll at at least 70. The United States has said the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. Russia has said it believes poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs. Sarin is an organophosporus compound and a nerve agent. Chlorine and mustard gas which are also believed to have been used in the past in Syria are not. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman did not say what agent was used in the attack but said the rebels had used the same chemical weapons in Aleppo last year. The WHO said it was likely that some kind of chemical was used in the attack because sufferers had no apparent external injuries and died from a rapid onset of similar symptoms including acute respiratory distress. It said its experts in Turkey were giving guidance to overwhelmed health workers in Idlib on the diagnosis and treatment of patients and medicines such as Atropine an antidote for some types of chemical exposure and steroids for symptomatic treatment had been sent. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Syria has previously said forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have used lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions. Hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. Assads government has always denied responsibility for that attack. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. But Russia a Syrian ally and China have repeatedly vetoed any United Nations move to sanction Assad or refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. ""These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism"" Peter Salama Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme said in the WHO statement. - REUTERS",nna,4/5/2017,idlib,0

A U.S. missile strike on an airbase near the Syrian city of Homs on Friday caused deaths but is not believed to have resulted in ""big human casualties"" Homs Governor Talal Barazi said. Barazi said the attack served the interests of ""armed terrorist groups"" including Islamic State adding that the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra. Barazi was speaking in a series of phone interviews with media on Friday. He confirmed deaths at the airbase in a phone interview with Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen.

Speaking at dawn he said rescue and fire-fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base. He said the attack was a form of ""support for the armed terrorist groups and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the Syrian Arab Army to combat terrorism"". Speaking to Syrian state TV Barazi said ""The Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. ""This targeting was not the first and I dont believe it will be the last"" he added. In separate comments to al-Mayadeen he said ""The war against terrorism will continue."" U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week declaring he acted in Americas ""national security interest"" against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. officials said the military fired dozens of cruise missiles against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel-held area that Washington has blamed on Assads forces. The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility. The U.S. strikes ""targeted military positions in Syria and in Homs specifically"" in order to publicly ""serve the goals of terrorism in Syria and the goals of Israel in the long run"" Barazi added in his interview with state TV.-REUTERS",nna,4/7/2017,homs,0

1914947538,Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown,"Sun 22 Feb 2015 Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown. A suicide bomber driving an ambulance killed four people on Sunday in an unprecedented attack on a hospital that took Syrias civil war to the ruling Assad clans hometown for the first time a monitoring group said. The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""A man drove an ambulance packed with explosives into the parking of the Qardaha hospital. Another man was in the vehicle with him but it was unclear whether he was an accomplice or a hostage. Four people were killed in the attack"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 killed a nurse a hospital employee and two soldiers said Observatory director Abdel Rahman. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province - where the town is located - has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent. - Troops kill 10 children - Meanwhile the Observatory said 10 children and 13 rebels were among 48 people executed by government forces in the northern village of Rityan earlier this week. The killings took place after troops entered the town Tuesday during an offensive aimed at cutting rebel supply lines to the Turkish border. Abdel Rahman said all the dead were from six families. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family."" The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive this week to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged Shiite villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters from Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The heavy fighting claimed the lives of 129 loyalists and 116 rebels including an Al-Nusra commander according to an Observatory toll. - Air raids kill thousands - While the ground offensive failed warplanes kept pounding rebel areas of Aleppo city and other parts of the country. On Saturday two women and two children were among eight people killed when a barrel bomb hit a building in an opposition-held area of Aleppo city once Syrias commercial capital. Six people were also reported killed in rebel shelling of regime-held areas of the city. The air force also killed at least 10 people in rebel areas east of Damascus Saturday the Observatory said. According to the group they were the latest of more than 7000 people killed across Syria since the UN Security Council passed a resolution last year ordering an end to sieges and indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas. The Observatory ""has documented the killing of 5812 civilians including 1733 children 969 women and 3110 men in barrel bombings and (other) air raids"" over the past year. Meanwhile rebel fire on regime-held areas killed 1102 people said the Observatory adding that 234 of them were children.

The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway. The town has been held by rebels since shortly after Syrias crisis began in March 2011. US airstrikes target the IS The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the death of two senior Islamic State group (IS) leaders in a suspected US airstrike on Monday. Abu Osama al-Iraqi and Amer al-Rafdan were killed in what is believed to have been US airstrikes in Hasakeh. A Saudi national Maher Meshaal known as Abu Hajar al-Hadrami was also killed in airstrikes in Hasakeh according to IS supporters on twitter CBS reported. Meshaal composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. The airstrikes come a week after President Barrack Obama announced the US would intensify its campaign of airstrikes against the IS in northern Syria.",alaraby,7/15/2015,idlib,1

Many pointed their fingers at the Syrian regime which denied any responsibility for the attack and described the massacre as fabricated fake accusations by the armed fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack believed to have been carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children at ages below 8. The Observatory added that warplanes continued to bomb the town following the attack which took place near a medical center where the victims of the first aggression were being treated. The attack also caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth the Observatory added. A high-ranking Syrian opposition official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the gas used during Tuesdays massacre had never been used before. Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA) Sami Nader said. This crime will constitute a turning point in the Syrian developments because it has embarrassed the Russians on the issue of chemicals. Meanwhile the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces said the attack killed more than 100 people including 25 children and 15 women and injured 400 others. A military source at the Free Syrian Army told Asharq Al-Awsat that the attack targeted a popular market in the center of Khan Sheikhoun. The attack only targeted civilians in order to push the residents of Idlib and its suburbs to migrate outside the Syrian border the source asserted. While UN war crimes investigators are looking into the alleged chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town in Idlib the Security Council is expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it is seriously concerned about the attack. It said its Fact Finding Mission (FFM) is in the process of gathering and analyzing information from all available sources. Several countries also condemned the attack. The White House considered it as unacceptable while US President Donald Trump said These heinous actions by the Bashar Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution.For his part French President Francois Hollande directly blamed Syrian regime forces for the attack while High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the regime of Assad bears primary responsibility.Commenting on what happened in Khan Sheikhoun UN special envoy for Syria Staffa de Mistura said This was horrific im sure there will be a Security Council meeting on this for clear identification of responsibilities accountability.

1918150027,Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria,April 18 2017 Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria. For two Syrian mothers on opposite sides of a two-year siege their evacuation from the blockade was supposed to end their suffering but that was not the case in wake of a bombing outside the city of Aleppo. Noha a Shiite and Samira a Sunni were besieged for nearly two years on each side of Syrias civil war. At the weekend they finally escaped the suffocating blockades under an evacuation agreement but their ordeal was not over. As they waited at two transit points miles apart outside Aleppo a bomb attack hit Nohas bus convoy killing more than 120 people including dozens of children. After ambulances rushed off the wounded new buses arrived and the two convoys eventually reached their destinations one in regime territory and the other in rebel territory. In the hours leading up to Saturdays attacks the two women spoke to Reuters about what they had left behind their families being split up and the likelihood they would never return home. Reuters was not allowed back past security to try to find Noha after the blast and lost contact with Samira after speaking to her earlier on another evacuees phone. Weve lost everything. We hope to go back one day but I dont expect we wil said Noha 45 asking not to be identified by her last name. Noha left al-Foua one of two Shiite villages besieged by Syrian insurgents in Idlib province with her two youngest children and 5000 other people under a deal between the Syrian regime and armed opposition. In exchange 2000 Sunni residents and rebel fighters from the regime-besieged town of Madaya near Damascus Samiras hometown were given safe passage out and bussed to Idlib province a rebel stronghold via Aleppo. Thousands of Syrians have been evacuated from besieged areas in recent months under deals between Bashar al-Assads regime and rebels fighting for six years to unseat him. Rebels say it amounts to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country and engenders demographic change because most of the opposition and Syrias population are Sunni. There was little choice. We had to leave we were scared said Samira 55 who was traveling with her five adult sons. She had feared her sons would be arrested or forced to join the Syrian regime forces and fight once troops and officials of the Damascus regime moved into the town. Like Noha Samira was relieved to have escaped a crushing siege which had caused widespread hunger and in the case of Madaya starvation but had left everything behind including family. We owned three houses farmland and three shops in Madaya town. Now we dont have a single Syrian pound she said. Her daughter pregnant with a third child had stayed in Madaya because her husband had vowed to live and die there she said. Samira has not heard from her own husband for nearly four years after he was arrested by the regime. With nothing left and no place to stay in Idlib other than camps Samira said she would try to migrate joining the 5 million Syrian refugees who have left since the war broke out in 2011. More than 6 million are internally displaced. I dont want to be in Idlib we know no one there. Also you dont know when or where the jets might bomb she said referring to the heavy bombardment by Russian and Syrian warplanes of rebel-held areas in Idlib including a recent alleged poison gas attack. The plan is to try to get to Turkey to leave Syria for good. Noha was also heading into the unknown. I dont know where well live whether they (authorities) have anything set up. At the very least we just want to be safe. The children jump at night from the sound of rockets. We just want security wherever they take us she said. Her adult son and daughter had stayed in al-Foua but were hoping to leave in the next stage of the evacuation deal. Nohas husband had been killed but she did not say how. Both women said they would never have left their hometowns but for the strangling sieges which caused severe food and medicine shortages and the gradual change of control in each area. On Saturday a deadly explosion killed at least 100 including children regime supporters and opposition fighters at an evacuation point adding new urgency to the widely criticized operation. The blast ripped through a bus depot in the al-Rashideen area where thousands of regime loyalists evacuated the day before waited restlessly for hours as opposition fighters guarded the area while negotiators bickered over the completion of the transfer deal. Only meters away hundreds of evacuees from pro-rebels areas also loitered in a walled-off parking lot guarded by regime troops.

Syrian state TV said an explosive device went off in the northern city of Aleppo killing six people and wounding 30 others. It did not provide further details on Wednesdays blast in the regime-held Salaheddin neighborhood. Opposition media groups including Aleppo Today said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter. Aleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain. Meanwhile the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday state media and activists said days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer. The Central Military Media said 3000 residents of two pro-regime villages Foua and Kafarya left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people including opposition fighters left Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province. The opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160 mostly gunmen had remained in Zabadani. The process has resumed with 3000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas the head of the Britain-based monitoring group Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Security was tightened up for Wednesdays departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked. The AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched. After repeated delays the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas killing more than 120 mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack which the regime blamed on the rebels. The transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations. Critics say the string of evacuations which could see some 30000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days rewards siege tactics and amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. All four areas have been under siege for years their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group put the death toll at 58 saying there were 11 children among the dead. Meanwhile the Idlib Media Center said dozens of people had been killed. There was no comment from the regime in Damascus or any international agency in the immediate aftermath of the attack. A Syrian regime source denied that the regime had used any such weapons saying the army does not and has not used chemical weapons not in the past and not in the future. It deemed such claims as rebel propaganda. It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun the site of Tuesdays alleged attack. The Syrian American Medical Society which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory said it had sent a team of inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun before noon and an investigation was underway. The Syrian activists had no information on what agent could have been used in the assault. They claimed the attack was caused by an airstrike carried out either by the regime or Russian warplanes. A Turkey-based Syrian woman whose niece husband and one-year-old daughter were among those killed said the warplanes struck early as residents were still in their beds she said speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared for the safety of family members back in Syria. Makeshift hospitals soon crowded with people suffocating. The province of Idlib is almost entirely controlled by the Syrian opposition. It is home to some 900000 displaced Syrians according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the regime is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province. Tuesdays reports came on the eve of a major international meeting in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region hosted by the EUs High Representative Federica Mogherini. Claims of chemical weapons attacks particularly the use of the chlorine agent are not uncommon in Syrias conflict. The worst attack was what a UN report said was an attack by toxic sarin gas in August 2013 on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians. The Syrian Coalition an opposition group based outside the country said regime planes carried out the airstrike on Khan Sheikhoun south of the city of Idlib the provincial capital. It said the planes fired missiles carrying poisonous gases killing dozens of people many of them women and children. The coalition described the attack as a horrifying massacre. Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun show limp bodies of children and adults. Some are seen struggling to breathe; others appear foaming at the mouth. A medical doctor going by the name of Dr. Shajul Islam for fears for his own safety said his hospital in Idlib province received three victims all with narrow pinpoint pupils that did not respond to light. He published video of the patients on his Twitter account. Pinpoint pupils breathing difficulties and foaming at the mouth are symptoms commonly associated with toxic gas exposure. The oppositions Civil Defense search-and-rescue group which released photos showing paramedics washing down victims has not published a casualty toll. The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims from the scene by a pickup truck. The victims were stripped down to their underwear. Many appeared unresponsive. Warplanes continued to pound the town after the attack including near a medical point where victims were being treated the Observatory said. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian regime of conducting at least eight chemical attacks using chlorine gas on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months in the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200. Also a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the regime was behind at least three attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas and the ISIS group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.

1918150031,MSF Syrian Regime Used Chemical Weapons in Hama,Posted on April 2 2017 by Youssef Diab MSF Syrian Regime Used Chemical Weapons in Hama Beirut Doctors Without Borders (MSF) accused the Syrian regime and its allies of using chemical weapons in their bombardment of the Hama governorate on March 25. MSF reported that the regime targeted Latamneh hospital in the northern Hama governorate killing two people and causing severe respiratory symptoms among patients and staff. The hospitals orthopedic surgeon Dr. Darwish was one of two people killed. Thirteen people were transferred to other facilities for treatment. It reported that at around 600 pm on March 25 the Latamneh hospital was targeted by a bomb dropped by a helicopter which hit the entrance of the building. The organization relied in its report on information from the hospital staff that proved that chemical weapons were used. Patients and staff reported suffering severe respiratory symptoms and burning of mucous membranessymptoms consistent with an attack using chemicals. The hospital went out of service for three days due to the attack after which the emergency room reopened. The hospital is located a few miles from the frontlines and provides medical care for around 8000 people. Prior to the attacks the hospital had an emergency room and inpatient department and provided general and orthopedic surgery. Massimiliano Rebaudengo MSFs head of mission in northern Syria said that the loss of Dr. Darwish leaves just two orthopedic surgeons for a population of around 120000. Bombing hospitals although banned by International Humanitarian Law remains a common practice in Syria and health services are severely affected by these repeated attacks he added. Over the past year MSF has received reports of at least 71 attacks on 32 different health facilities which it runs or supports in Syria. On February 22 an MSF-supported health facility in Idlib governorate was hit by rockets killing six and wounding 33 others. Meanwhile Al-Nasr Army announced that the Hama battle will continue and the retreat of rebels from several locations does not mean they have been defeated. Battles continued between the regime forces and opposition factions on all fronts in Hama coinciding with dozens of air raids by Russian and Syrian war planes. Al-Nasr Army military spokesperson Lieutenant Iyad al-Homsi said The criminal gangs resorted to chemical weapons when they were no longer able to defeat us in the battlefield. Speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat he added Those who witness the number of deaths of regime forces and its affiliated militias will realize that victory is ours. We have proven to the world that after six years of killing destruction and displacement that our revolution will continue. Head of the Hama Media center Abu Yazan al-Noiami said that the retreat of rebel forces and the consequent advances of the regime over the past two days were caused by the regimes use of chemical gases. He added that both the regime and Iranian forces are resorting to media blackouts to hide the very high figures of their losses. He stressed Hundreds of Iranian militants were killed and over 30 tanks personnel vehicles and cannons were destroyed in this battle. In a new development 17 armed factions in coastal regions Aleppo Hama and Idlib announced that they agreed to form a comprehensive military operations room aimed at fighting the Syrian regime and restoring stability in the region. Opposition website al-Durrar al-Shamiyyah reported an informed source as saying that factions of al-Jabha al-Shamiyyah al-Sham Legion Mujahideen Army al-Nasr Army Idlib Army Freedom Brigade the Middle Company and many others are part of this operations room. According to the source Colonel Fadlullah Naji of the al-Sham Legion will head the room adding that during the last month and a half the troops had been meeting to agree on all details which he did not disclose. He said that the final meeting will be held in the coming few days to present the framework of the room after which it will be officially announced.

Meanwhile a spokesman for Syria Civil Defence said that 33 people mostly women and the children were affected by the gas which they suspect was chlorine in Saraqeb Idlib province. Medium-sized barrels containing toxic gases fell close to where a Russian military helicopter had been shot down hours earlier. The Syria Civil Defence which describes itself as a neutral group of volunteers that carry out searches and rescue work in areas controlled by the armed opposition posted a video on YouTube that showed a number of men trying to breathe and members dressed in the Syria Civil Defence uniforms giving them oxygen masks. Syria Civil Defence workers who went to the site said that they suspected that the gas used was chlorine gas but that it is difficult to confirm this. The organisations spokesman said that Medium-sized barrels fell containing toxic gases. The Syrian Civil Defence was not able to determine the type of the gas. Monitors at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence on all sides in the civil war said barrel bombs fell on Saraqeb late on Monday wounding a large number of citizens. Reuters quoted the US State Department as saying that it was looking into the reported use of chemical weapons in Saraqeb. Its spokesman John Kirby said that he is not in a position to confirm the veracity of (the reports) and continued by saying Certainly if its true it would be extremely serious. Russias Ministry of Defence said that a Russian helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb on Monday killing all five people on board in the biggest officially acknowledged loss of life experienced by Russian forces since they started operations in Syria. Government and opposition forces have both denied using chemical weapons during the civil war that has been going on for the last five years.

The ISIS run Amaq news agency said that 160 civilians were killed in raids on the Manbij countryside whilst an international coalition source did not deny that airstrikes had been carried out in Manbij recently and said that an investigation into the matter is being carried out. The source told Asharq Al-Awsat that. We have seen the reports that indicate that people were killed as a result of the shelling and we are now collecting information on the matter from several parties some of which were close to the sites that were targeted. Based on the results we will take necessary measures. We would like to stress that we take precautions and measures to avoid targeting civilians and minimise the harm that may affect them. Meanwhile the US military announced in a statement that opposition fighters that are backed by the United States and are fighting ISIS militants in Syria took control of a base from which operations were led in the city of Manbij at the beginning of the week.

1918150039,Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town,Posted on July 2 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat English Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town Thirty civilians were killed on Saturday in intensive Syrian air strikes on a Damascan suburb town northeast of the city a day after the reported execution of a Syrian air force pilot a monitor and rebels said. The raids targeted a medical center a school and a residential area in Jayrud town rebels said. Jayrud is a heavily populated area that struck a local truce with the army that had saved it from the heavy bombing on other rebel held areas. It had made it a sanctuary for thousands of civilians fleeing heavy battles nearby. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said scores were also injured in the aerial strikes as well as shelling from army posts in the area. A rebel spokesman said the strikes seemed to be in retaliation for the killing of a Syrian air force pilot who parachuted down near the town after his plane crashed on Friday. The strikes against civilians are in retaliation against the execution of the pilot by Nusra Front said Said Seif al Qalamoni from the Free Syrian Armys (FSA) Shahid Ahmad Abdo brigade that operates in Jayrud alongside the al Qaedas Nusra Front and other groups. Rebels in a joint operations room targeted a main army base in the region with Russian-made surface to surface missiles after the aerial strikes al Qalamoni said. Syrian state media said the crash was due to a technical fault and the pilot had ejected while the rebel group Jaish al-Islam said it had shot down the plane but did not say how. Jaish al Islam said the pilot was arrested and was subsequently killed by a fighter from the Nusra Front while being held at a joint command center. The army had warned of a strong response after the execution of the pilot was reported shortly after he was shown on a rebel video circulated on social media giving details of his mission. Separately Russian and Syrian planes intensified their bombing on Saturday of a strategic rebel-held area of Aleppo that is near the only route into opposition-held parts of the northern city. If the Malah area were to fall to the army and its allies they would succeed in laying siege to areas where over 400000 people live under rebel control.

The bomb was dropped at a time when the United Nations envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura emphasized that there is a lot of evidence that chlorine gas is being used in Aleppo and If it did take place it is a war crime.

1918150046,Syria Kurdish Islamist violence kills 12 Al-Qaeda-linked fighters,Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution. Nazeer Rida,asharqalawsat,8/3/2013,hasakeh,1
1918398776,Syrian army advances near Aleppo,"Published February 18 2015 The Syrian army backed by allied militia has captured several villages north of Aleppo from insurgents and fighting has blocked a main supply route leading into the northern city a monitoring group said on Tuesday. A U.N. mediator has been struggling to broker a ceasefire in Aleppo and government forces had long been expected to try to encircle it completely aiming to drive insurgents from Syrias second city and take control of their main supply road. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said pro-government forces had blocked a road leading towards the Turkish border as heavy clashes continued there. The army also took villages including Bashkuwi and Sifat while battles raged in Hardatain and Ratain said the Observatory which tracks the Syrian conflict using sources on the ground. It added that at least 16 insurgents were killed. Aleppo is at the heart of clashes between pro-government forces and a range of insurgents which include extremist brigades al Qaedas hardline Syria wing Nusra Front foreign fighters in other groups and Western-backed rebels. ""It is very important because if they continue like this they will completely cut the supply lines for the future. The Syrian regime is moving forward there"" the Observatorys founder Rami Abdulrahman said. More than 210000 people have died in the Syrian conflict which will enter its fifth year next month the Observatory has estimated with fighting between numerous factions regularly flaring across the country. Villages and towns outside Aleppo have passed between pro-government and insurgent fighters before. Insurgent-held districts in the divided city have come under heavy air force bombardment while Syrian state television said on Tuesday that five people had been killed and 18 wounded in ""terrorist"" rocket attacks in Aleppo neighborhoods. A television channel run by Lebanese group Hezbollah which is fighting alongside pro-government units reported that the Syrian army had taken control of areas north of Aleppo. The Observatory said Hezbollah was involved in the battle. The pro-government al-Watan newspaper said on Monday that government forces aimed to completely surround the city this week in a major offensive against insurgent groups. In December mainly extremist insurgent factions in Aleppo grouped together to form Jabhat al-Shamiyya the Levant Front an attempt at unity among their fighters. Last month the Western-backed rebel group Hazzm movement joined the alliance after coming under pressure from Nusra Front. Recent Syrian army progress in the area has reduced the chances of a truce between the government and disparate insurgent groups diplomats say. Since October U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura has been working on a plan to broker ""local freezes"" in Syria.",dailysabah,2/18/2015,aleppo,0

The Britain-based monitor said that villagers had discovered the bodies when they returned to their homes after the regime forces withdrew a day later. Five women and 13 rebels from the six families were among the dead. ""The troops and militiamen knew exactly where they lived thanks to the informers who accompanied them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family"" he added. Activist Mamun Abu Omar said some of the bodies had been mutilated. Syrian regime forces killed 48 alleged rebels in Hardatnin village in Aleppo in northern Syria according to a statement released Saturday by the Syrian Revolution General Commission. Regime forces killed 48 civilians by shooting or slaughtering the victims before withdrawing from the village Friday night. The victims included women and children. The massacre was discovered when the rebels completely seized control of Hardatnin village on Saturday according to the statement. The opposition forces freed 150 civilians who were captured at a school in the village. A field hospital documented a list of the 48 victims names. Mustafa Sultan a local activist in the area confirmed the death toll saying that regime forces backed by Hezbollah factions killed the civilians before their withdrawal. A report released by a group of U.N. experts investigating war crimes on Friday said that ""unthinkable"" crimes continue to occur on a daily basis in Syria as the conflict approaches its fifth year. The U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria called for urgent attention to be paid to the shocking crimes committed by the Syrian regime Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant militants and other armed opposition groups. The report said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assads regimes ""surrender or starve"" siege strategy has left thousands of people particularly infants dead over the past four years citing the victims describing the regimes strategy as that of ""draining the sea to kill the fish."" The regime has been using barrel bombs since 2012 targeting crowded areas such as bakery lines transportation hubs apartment buildings markets and aid distributions which led to an increase in the number of persons with disabilities according to the report. The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive launched this week to try to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages initially taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters of Al-Qaida affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Syria has been gripped by violence since the regime launched a violent crackdown in response to anti-government protests in March 2011 triggering a conflict that has left at least 210000 people dead and displaced almost half of the countrys population according to the U.N.",dailysabah,2/23/2015,aleppo,0

The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person"" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast.

1918398782,US-led airstrikes target ISIS stronghold Raqqa,"Published July 5 2015 U.S.-led coalition aircraft unleashed a series of airstrikes targeting the self proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) groups stronghold of Raqqa in eastern Syria in what the coalition said Sunday was one of its most sustained aerial operations carried out in Syria to date. ISIS said at least 10 people were killed and many others wounded. At least 16 airstrikes were reported late Saturday and early Sunday triggering successive explosions that shook the city and created panic among residents activists said. The U.S.-led coalition often targets ISIS-held towns and cities in Syria but the overnight strikes on Raqqa were rare in their intensity. In a statement issued early Sunday the coalition said it had conducted 16 airstrikes throughout Raqqa destroying vital ISIS-controlled structures and transit routes in Syria. ""The significant airstrikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" said coalition spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Gilleran using the Arabic acronym for the ISIS group. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move"" from Raqqa he said. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the so-called caliphate declared a year ago by the ISIS terror group in territories it controls in Iraq and Syria. The sustained airstrikes add pressure on the militants in Raqqa still reeling from last months loss of the border town of Tal Abyad to Kurdish fighters. The town on the Turkish border was a major avenue for commerce and smuggling for the group. A militant website said 10 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. An ISIS-affiliated Facebook page said one civilian was among those killed and 10 were wounded including women and children. It also said the bombing destroyed several bridges. The ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency released a video of what it said was the effects of shelling Saturday by a U.S. drone on Raqqa. It showed several wounded men on a stretcher and at least three young boys being treated for wounds at what appeared to be a hospital. A Raqqa-based anti-ISIS activist network reported eight civilians were killed by the coalition airstrikes including a 10-year-old child. The casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. The network called Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered said at least one airstrike targeted a group of ISIS members in the city center. Another targeted an ISIS checkpoint while a third destroyed large parts of an ISIS-held brick factory in the city. In the remote northeastern city of Hassakeh ISIS suicide bombers detonated an explosives-laden truck near a main power plant Sunday. State-run news agency SANA reported casualties and damage in the plant on the southern edge of the city. Fighting has raged in Hassakeh since the ISIS group attacked several southern neighborhoods held by government troops earlier this month. The violence has forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. The predominantly Kurdish city was split between government forces and Kurdish fighters who have been fighting the ISIS group separately. In Iraq a Defense Ministry statement said government forces repelled an ISIS attack Sunday morning on the town of Haditha and the nearby Haditha dam in Anbar province. At least 20 militants were killed in the failed attack said the statement which did not provide any further information. Iraqi forces backed by Shiite militias have been struggling to recapture areas lost to the ISIS group in the countrys west and north. In May the militant group scored a stunning victory overrunning Ramadi the provincial capital of western Anbar province. Yet Haditha and some other towns remain under control of government forces and allied Sunni tribal fighters. In Lebanon some 200 Kurdish nationals staged a demonstration in downtown Beirut in solidarity with their brethren in Syria who are fighting against ISIS militants.",dailysabah,7/5/2015,raqqa,1

According to Syria Turks Association tanks artillery and missiles were used in the attack and explosions were also heard in villages located on the Turkish side of the border. Four wounded were brought to hospitals in Turkeys Hatay province for treatment. The attack is a larger part of the operation as Syrian army announced on Sunday that it had stepped up air strikes and retaken villages in a new offensive on opposition forces in coastal province of Latakia. Aerial bombardment had intensified over the past 48 hours in a bid to cut rebel supply lines in rugged territory close to Turkeys border an army source was quoted as saying on state media. Latakia province - home to Syrias biggest port and a stronghold of President Bashar al Assads Alawite sect - has been a key battleground of the conflict which is now in its fifth year. Sunni Muslim groups including al Qaedas Syrian offshoot the Nusra Front control many villages in the borderlands north of the government-held Mediterranean port city of Latakia and other areas dominated by Alawites who follow an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The army said five villages and hilltops including Beit Khadour Beit Zaifa Tel alKhadar and Jabal al Rahmaliya had been wrested back from the insurgents bringing it closer to the border areas. The army had stepped up its campaign in the province since insurgents took the strategically located town of Jisr al Shughour in April strengthening their position in a mountain range that overlooks Alawite villages and close to Qardaha hometown of the Assad family. The area has been in control of opposition forces since September 2012. The rough terrain and heavy forests has allowed the opposition forces to resist heavy Syrian army shelling and withstand heavy aerial bombing defense analysts say. A Syrian army officer said the aim of the latest operation was to cut rebel supply lines from the Turkish border to the rebel held villages including the town of Salma that has been held by Nusra Front since 2012. ""These armed men are weaker than to try to dare get close to Latakia"" a senior army officer was quoted as saying in a report from the area by Lebanese Hezbollahs television al-Manars correspondent. Last year the Syrian army wrested back control of the Christian town border town of Kasab a gateway to Turkey nearer the coast in Latakia after less than three months of control by opposition forces including Nusra Front.

(Reuters Photo) Airstrikes on Daesh-held villages in northern Syria killed at least 85 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said. Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.,dailysabah,7/19/2016,aleppo,1

Bashar Assads forces with assistance from Russian airstrikes is continuing its siege of opposition groups in Aleppo and is attempting to cut a road leading into the opposition-held section of the city while the groups continue to wage fierce battles despite intensified airstrikes some of which have reportedly targeted civilians. The groups had previously launched an attack against regime positions in the historic center of Aleppo on Monday in response to an offensive on Castello Road which is used for supplies and access severing opposition-held areas under siege where at least 250000 people live. Regime airstrikes killed 20 civilians on Monday in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood of Aleppo Syria Live Network (SLN) reported. One civilian was killed and many others were injured by a regime barrel bomb dropped on al-Jalloum. Many civilians were wounded in the attacks on the al-Ansari neighborhood. Inflicting heavy casualties in the battlefield the regime also intensified its aerial artillery and missile bombardment on the neighborhoods of Bab Qensrin al-Kallaseh Bab al-Hadid and Bab al-Nasr in Aleppos old city. Eyewitnesses said that the regime used cluster bombs and vacuum bombs in the airstrikes. Elsewhere jets believed to be Russian or Syrian also struck a fuel market in a town in the northwestern province of Idlib killing 18 people and injuring scores more according to a local rescue worker near the site. An airstrike hit a local field hospital in the town of Ahsem in Idlib province killing three people including a child an international charity and an aid worker said. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods of Aleppo. The assault was ""a response to the [government] attempts to advance"" Zakaria Malahifji of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. He said insurgents had already made gains and that much of the fighting was taking place in Aleppos ancient old city a renowned UNESCO World Heritage site now largely in ruins. A witness reported fierce close-range clashes near the historic citadel where the opposition killed at least 20 army troops when they blew up a tunnel they dug underneath a regime post. The city Syrias largest before the war has been a main battleground in the countrys five-year war and has seen an escalation of fighting after peace talks and a fragile ceasefire broke down earlier this year. Its capture would be a strategic prize for the Assad regime which controls the major population centers in western Syria apart from opposition-held areas of Aleppo and the city of Idlib. Opposition also control pockets of territory elsewhere in western Syria. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods in Aleppo killing five people and wounding dozens more observers said. A U.N. spokeswoman said that intensified fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels in contested Aleppo has completely cut off the only road allowing access for humanitarian aid deliveries into the rebel-held part of the city. Alessandra Vellucci said on Tuesday that the Castello Road considered the only access in and out of eastern Aleppo has been rendered ""impassable"" since hostilities there worsened last week. Vellucci said the U.N. estimates that 300000 people depend on the road which allows for the flow of supplies goods and civilians into the area. She said the U.N. continues to receive ""distressing reports of aerial bombardment and shelling on civilian locations in both western and eastern Aleppo."" She called on all sides to protect civilians and ease access for humanitarian access to all.

A large truck bomb was set off near the security headquarters of the Kurdish administration that controls most of Hasaka province in the northeast said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise because of the number of people seriously injured added the Observatory. The official SANA news agency said at least 140 people were injured. The attack was initially believed to be a double bombing but sources in the city and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said the initial attack caused a gas tank to detonate.

(TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of ""clay and adobe"" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing ""a woman with four of her children and an old man"" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

(TRT World and Agencies) Syrian rebel forces advanced into a key regime-held district in Aleppo on Monday to reopen the last remaining supply route into opposition-held districts. The offensive to gain control of the strategic Castello Road in the Al Mallah district came at dawn just days after the area was encircled by regime forces. Control over the Castello Road is the only way that some 250000 besieged residents of east Aleppo can have access to essentials like food and fuel. The regimes capture of the district days ago had come during an extension of a nationwide truce declared last week by the regime to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al Fitr.

The war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said those killed had died from suffocation and the effects of a toxic gas. The weapons used caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths SOHR said citing medical sources who described the air strikes as a ""toxic gas attack."" Fifteen victims mostly women and children were brought to Turkey for treatment. International condemnation Turkeys Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey condemns the suspected chemical attack describing it as a crime against humanity. He said the attack could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. EUs diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said the regime of Bashar al Assad bears ""primary responsibility"" for the attack. ""Today the news is awful"" Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. French President Francois Hollande accused Assad regime of responsibility for a ""massacre"". ""Once again the Syrian regime will deny the evidence of its responsibility for this massacre"" Hollande said in a statement. The White House also blamed the attack on the regime saying the incident was ""reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilised world."" ""These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administrations weakness and irresolution"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also condemned the attack saying those responsible should be ""held to account.""

(TRT World and Agencies) Air strikes by Syrian regime on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. A witness at the town hospital said he saw many wounded people their faces bloodied. All the facilitys beds were occupied by men women and children. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. Devastating regime siege The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating regime siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of regime leader Bashar Al Assad. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. Source TRTWorld and agencies",trt,4/3/2017,damascus,1

Cavusoglu also said he told his Russian counterpart that Moscow did not take the necessary steps in the face of breaches in the Syrian ceasefire. Meanwhile Iraqs influential Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr also called on the regimes leader to step down and spare his country further bloodshed. Sadr who commands a large following among the urban poor of Baghdad and the southern cities is the first Iraqi Shia political leader to urge Assad to step down. Defeating Daesh The top priority for the United States in Syria is to defeat Daesh Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a TV interview on Sunday. ""Once Daesh threat has been reduced or eliminated I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilising the situation in Syria"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson cancelled a visit to Moscow scheduled for April 10 after the poison gas attack in Syria. The decision by Johnson to cancel the visit to Moscow later this month shows a lack of understanding of events in Syria Russias Foreign Ministry said on Sunday. The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian backers have vowed to keep up the fight against ""terrorists"" despite threats of further US strikes against the regime following the chemical attack. The US launched a cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base in response to the attack on Friday. Scores of people died and many were injured on Tuesday after the regime air strike dropped chemical bombs onto the town of Khan Shaykhun.

1919191766,Multiple Daesh suicide bombers attack refugee camp in Syria,"2 May 2017 At least 24 people were killed on Tuesday in a Daesh attack near a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. ""In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo."" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was ""100 percent"" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

On June 23 the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into western districts of Manbij after blocking the road south of the city heading to ISs de facto capital of Raqqa. But their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the militants which are also fighting back by launching suicide attacks against the SDF.

Tags MSF Syria Idlib Russia A hospital funded by medical charity Medcins Sans Frontieres [MSF] in a rebel-held province of northern Syria was destroyed by airstrikes over the weekend that killed 13 people MSF said on Monday. Among the dead were four staff and five children. ""The direct bombing of another hospital in Syria is an outrage said Silvia Dallatomasina MSFs medical manager of operations in northwest Syria while also calling for an immediate end to attacks on hospitals in Syrias war. MSF said that the hospital in Millis Idlib province was hit directly by two airstrikes that forced the closure of the medical facility. The hospital served as a referral centre specialising in pediatrics with an operating theatre and an intensive care unit. MSF did not specify which government was behind the attacks however Russia was on Monday accused of dropping phosphorous bombs on central Idlib late Sunday night. The bombings came as rebel groups on the ground prepared for fresh assaults on regime positions. The medical charity said that the attack has deprived around 70000 people in Millis and the surrounding towns of medical care as it used to cater for up to 250 people a day. Hospitals have been regularly targeted in Syrias conflict with the UN recording 44 attacks in July alone on medical facilities in the war-torn country. The government of President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Moscow have denied bombing hospitals in their campaigns against rebel groups. According to MSF two medical centres that it supports in Idlib have reported a total of nice mass influxes of injured people in July. In this month alone 466 patients have been reported as wounded and 37 have died. These same rebel-controlled facilities reported 294 wounded and 33 dead in a total of seven mass influxes for the first six months of 2016. Read Also",alaraby,8/9/2016,idlib,0

The defence ministry said the raids also destroyed a weapons storage facility and a training camp for IS fighters to the north and southeast. The ministry said that the extremists had suffered ""significant material damages"" in the strikes and that ""a large number of fighters have been killed."" The raids comes a day after the ministry said it would halt fire around Syrias ravaged city of Aleppo for three hours each day to allow humanitarian aid in an initiative the United Nations said is insufficient to meet the citys needs. The UN has called for urgent aid access to Aleppo and 48-hour weekly pauses for the aid deliveries warning that civilians are at grave risk from water shortages and disease as fighting has intensified.

The regime launched eight air raids - on the citys Kurdish-run south-western neighbourhoods - on Friday after an uneasy truce between regime and Kurdish militias broke down earlier this week leading to the latest bout of fighting. Images showed footage the city - reportedly Hassakeh - burning last night following one air raid. Control for Hassakeh city - the capital of the north-eastern province by the same name - is mostly in the hands of Kurdish forces while the rest is held by regime loyalists. Clashes between the two sides have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - dead according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Bombing and fighting has forced thousands of Hassakeh locals to flee in one of the most intense confrontations between the two sides in months. Thursdays air raids on Hassakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. Damascus forces and Kurdish fighters have enjoyed a truce while the Islamic State group threatens the province and other Kurdish areas jointly controlled by the two sides. In Hassakeh and Qamishli tensions have led to armed clashes. Kurdish units have proclaimed independence of an autonomous region around the Turkish border and deeper into Syria and demanded that the pro-regime militias disband in Hassakeh. A regime source in Hassakeh told AFP that the bombing was ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"". Kurdish militias are key US allies in the fight against IS providing them with weapons and advisers on the battlefield. The US has also reportedly opened up an air base in Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory while Russia - which is helping prop up the regime - is also close to the Kurdish units.

A woman and a child were also among the dead the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human rights said. Videos and images also emerged on social media showing children afflicted by burns that activists say were caused by incendiary weapons. This escalation in attacks came a day after the Damascus suburb of Daraya was evacuated by rebels after relentless bombing and a tough siege. The strikes were the first of their kind on Homs rebel-held areas in a year. In December local leaders and the government agreed a UN-sponsored deal that would see fighters evacuated and the regime take control of the city. No progress has been seen on this plan which requires local resistors to surrender their heavy weapons. Prior to this a truce in Homs in 2014 allowed for the withdrawal of fighters from the Old City leaving al-Waer in rebel hands. Since then the neighbourhood has been choked by a seige enforced by government troops and loyalist militias. This has blocked deliveries of all supplies of aid to the area save a few UN-led deliveries. An estimated 50000 civilians are currently trapped in Al-Waer alongside several thousand fighters. The seige on Al-Waer is part of what Washington has decried as Damascus ""surrender-or-starve"" tactic of beseiging rebel-controlled areas into capitulation or death.

Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 which has trapped over 300000 civilains and is targeted regularly by airstrikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. The World Health Organization last week demanded immediate humanitarian access to the area saying residents are in desperate need of medical attention. Time is running out for the people of East Ghouta. As health needs increase available resources are being depleted day by day. Our main goal now is to provide access to lifesaving care for thousands of vulnerable men women and children immediately said Elizabeth Hoff WHO Representative in Syria. All 3 public hospitals and 17 public health care centres in East Ghouta are nonfunctioning and inaccessible to the population the WHO said in a statement. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

""There has been fierce artillery shelling and airstrikes since yesterday and 165 people total have been wounded"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. Hundreds of people were killed in Eastern Ghouta in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops in August 2013. On Tuesday at least 58 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun according to the Observatory. Dozens more suffered respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the monitor and doctors at the scene said. More than 320000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.",alaraby,4/4/2017,damascus,0

Tags Shayrat cruise missiles US Homs Idlib Khan Sheikhun Fifty nine US cruise missiles struck a Syrian regime airbase in Homs province early Friday morning which appears to have caused severe damage to the infamous military site. Shayrat Airfield was allegedly the launch pad for a devastating chemical attack on an Idlib village that left up to a hundred civilians dead including scores of women and children. A potent symbol of regime oppression the airfield has been used for countless air raids on civilian targets and the second largest airbase in Syria. It now appears to be inoperable after sustaining severe damage from the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by two US destroyers. ""All aircraft located there have been damaged you can say it is completely destroyed"" regime TV reported while state news agency SANA said that six people were killed in the attack. Pro-regime media have reported that 15 regime fighter planes were destroyed and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sukhoi-22s Sukhoi-24s and MiG-23s were based there. [click to enlarge] Russia was given prior warning by the US which likely prevented the killing of large numbers of air and ground crew but it appears some were caught by the missiles. Dozens of regime personnel were reported killed or injured in the attack with damage to air defences housing for officers and a fuel depot according to the observatory. Although it appears the airfield will no longer be used for more bombings by regime planes the regime still has many options while Russia still maintains the huge Hmeimem airbase in Latakia. The brief lull in regime bombing should still provide some relief for the civilians of Idlib. Read Also",alaraby,4/7/2017,homs,1

Tags Syria Idlib airstrike Russian human rights Homs bombing Islamic State At least 18 civilians including five children and two women were killed in an airstrike on Syrias northwestern province of Idlib on Saturday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. An earlier death toll from the strike on the rebel stronghold of Urum al-Joz reported 15 people were killed but three more died after sustaining serious injuries. The names of all 18 killed were listed by Ariha Today activist group which said the death toll is likely to rise as many of the wounded remain in critical conditions. The Britain-based Observatory said the strike was likely to have been carried out by Russian war jets which operate in support of the Syrian regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by a rebel alliance that includes former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and is regularly targeted by both the Syrian regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. Much of the international community accused Bashar al-Assads regime of responsibility for that attack though Damascus involved responsibility. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assads regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning. In return Moscow announced it would ramp up air defences in Syria in an attempt to show a tough line on the US actions. Bus bombing in Homs province Also on Saturday Syrian state TV reported a bomb exploded aboard a bus carrying workers near the central city of Homs killing a woman and wounding 25. It gave no further details about the explosion but the governor of Homs province Talal Barrazi told AP the bomb was placed inside a bus that transports workers at a private factory. The Observatory confirmed a woman was killed in the blast saying it also wounded more than 20 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State group have carried out similar attacks in the past.

The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional.

Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame.

But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday.

Tags Syria Damascus Eastern Ghouta Assad UN SOHR Intense Syrian regime bombardment on rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region has killed eight civilians and wounded 25. Six days of heavy bombing have killed dozens in the region where rebel groups and regime forces are locked in a cycle of tit-for-tat attacks. Government forces have escalated their bombardment of Eastern Ghouta an opposition stronghold outside Damascus since hardline rebel group Ahrar al-Sham attacked a military base in the area last week. Since Tuesday heavy artillery fire and air strikes on Eastern Ghouta have killed at least 66 civilians including 13 children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as well as three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets. At least 281 people have been wounded the Britain-based monitor said on Sunday. Rebel groups meanwhile have fired rockets into Damascus neighbourhoods killing at least 16 people since Thursday the Observatory said. The toll included two people killed by rocket fire on Sunday. Eastern Ghouta is supposed to be part of a ""de-escalation zone"" under a deal between Russia Iran and Turkey aimed at reducing the level of violence. President Bashar al-Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2013 making humanitarian conditions in the area where some 400000 people live extremely dire. On Sunday the UNs coordinator for humanitarian and development affairs in Syria Ali al-Zaatari called on ""all warring sides to avoid targeting civilians"". ""For days there have been daily reports about civilians being killed and others being severely wounded in addition to warehouses hospitals and schools being put out of service during the exchange of shellfire particularly in Damascus and Eastern Ghouta"" Zaatari said. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

Tags Syria Assad Russia Eastern Ghouta Douma airstrikes More than 19 civilians were killed in Eastern Ghouta on Sunday as the Syrian regime stepped up its campaign to retake the last major opposition stronghold near the capital Damascus. At least 123 civilians have been killed in the besieged suburb by airstrikes and shelling since the Syrian regime and Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A witness told Reuters that there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning with warplanes heavily bombing the towns of Mesraba Harasta and Eastern Ghouta killing at least 19 civilians. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week that the intensifying bombardments were forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by Syrian regime forces since 2013 and no food aid convoys have entered the town of Douma since wheat flour rations in August. Civilians are eating rubbish fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days because of the food shortage the UN World Food Programme said this week. Nearly 174500 people trapped in the town of Douma since September have been forced to adopt emergency ""coping strategies"" the UN said. WFP expects the situation to further deteriorate in the coming weeks when the current food stock is expected to be depleted completely eroding the current household coping strategies.

Tags Russia Syria Assad Deir az-Zour Islamic State SOHR At least 53 civilians including 21 children perished early Sunday morning when Russian air strikes hit ""residential buildings"" in a village held by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah in Deir az-Zour province on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The monitor had initially given a death toll of 34 civilians but the number spiked after more bodies were recovered. ""The toll increased after removing the debris in a long day of rescue operation"" Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP adding the strikes hit ""residential buildings"". At least 18 people were also wounded in the air raids he added. Russia is a close ally of Syrias President Bashar al-Assad and in September 2015 began a military intervention in support of his government that has gradually helped Damascus regain territory. Syrias Deir az-Zour is one of the last places IS jihadists hold territory in the country after being driven from their major strongholds including their one-time de facto Syrian capital Raqqa city. The oil-rich eastern province that borders Iraq was once almost completely under IS control but the jihadists now hold just nine percent of Deir az-Zour according to the Observatory. They have faced two separate offensives there one led by the regime with Russian backing and the other by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters. Russia in drivers seat The latest strikes come as the United Nations tries to revitalise its flagging efforts to end a six-year civil war that has left Syria devastated and huge swathes of its population refugees. Syrias Deir az-Zour [click to enlarge] On Tuesday the eighth round of UN-brokered talks will kick off. They have achieved little so far but may be bolstered by the oppositions decision to bring a unified delegation to Geneva for the first time. For progress to happen rival sides will need to overcome the hurdle that has derailed past discussions the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He retains Moscows support but is loathed by much of Syrias rebel opposition who want him gone. Backed by Russias decisive military support Assads government has regained control of 55 percent of the country including major cities Damascus Aleppo Homs and Hama and around two-thirds of the population lives in regime-held areas. The rest is carved up between rebel factions jihadists and Kurdish forces. Some experts believe that Russia has clearly put itself in the drivers seat in recent months especially as US President Donald Trumps administration has pulled back from Syrian diplomatic front. Russia fellow regime ally Iran and rebel-backer Turkey have hosted negotiations in the Kazakh capital Astana that led to the creation of four ""de-escalation zones"" which produced a drop in violence though deadly air strikes and battles continue in some areas. And this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a ""congress"" of Syrian regime and opposition figures a move backed by Ankara and Tehran. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army.

An AFP correspondent in the village of Deir Sharqi where one of the hospitals was hit saw extensive damage and wards buried in rubble. It was the third time in less than a week that medical facilities in the province controlled by rebels and Islamist militant groups had been hit in air strikes. ""Apparently Russian aircraft... carried out four successive raids at dawn on a hospital on the outskirts"" of Deir Sharqi it said. ""Six civilians in the emergency department were killed including two babies in incubators after the destruction of the facilitys oxygen generator"" which was keeping them alive Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. The AFP correspondent saw at least one destroyed incubator rooms and corridors filled with rubble and dusty or damaged beds and equipment. In one room a wall had collapsed on a medicine shelf and in another medical supplies were strewn across the room.

Saturdays blast hit a convoy carrying residents from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya as they waited at a transit point in rebel-held Rashidin west of Aleppo. At least 68 children were among the 126 people killed in the attack the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said updating a previous toll of 112 dead. At least 109 of the dead were evacuees the Britain-based monitoring group said while the rest were aid workers and rebels guarding the convoy. The evacuations were taking place under a deal between Syrias regime and rebels that is also seeing residents and rebels transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. The agreement is the latest in a string of evacuation deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence after more than six years of civil war. Rebels say they amount to forced relocations after years of bombardment and crippling sieges. Body parts and the belongings of evacuees - including clothes dishes and even televisions - were still strewn at the scene of the attack on Sunday an AFP correspondent said. The shattered buses were nearby as was the shell of a pick-up truck - with little left but its engine block - that was apparently used to carry out the bombing. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing though the key Ahrar al-Sham rebel group denied any involvement. The government blamed ""terrorists"" - a catch-all term for its opponents. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria to monitor the conflict said hundreds of people were also wounded in the blast. It said a petrol station at the transit point was caught up in the explosion adding to the number of victims. The Syrian Red Crescent said three of its workers were among the wounded. Maysa al-Aswad a 30-year-old evacuee from Kafraya said she was sitting on one of the buses with her six-month-old son Hadi and 10-year-old daughter Narjis when the blast shook the parked convoy. ""Hadi was on my lap and Narjis on a chair next to me. When the explosion happened I hugged them both and we fell to the floor"" she told AFP by telephone from near Aleppo. ""I didnt know what was happening all I could hear was people crying and shouting"" she said. ""All I can think about is how we survived all the death during the last few years and then could have died just after we finally escaped."" More than 5000 people left Fuaa and Kafraya and about 2200 left Madaya and Zabadani on Friday the latest in a series of evacuations from the four towns under the agreement. The evacuation process resumed after the bombing the Observatory said with the residents of Fuaa and Kafraya eventually arriving in Aleppo Syrias second city which the government gained full control of last year. Wounded survivors including many children were taken for treatment at an Aleppo hospital. UN aid chief Stephen OBrien condemned the bombing saying in a statement ""The perpetrators of such a monstrous and cowardly attack displayed a shameless disregard for human life."" Pope Francis on Sunday also urged an end to the war in Syria as he presided over the traditional Easter mass in Rome. The pontiff said he hoped that Jesus Christs sacrifice might help bring ""comfort and relief to the civil population in Syria prey to a war that continues to sow horror and death"". The residents and rebels from Madaya and Zabadani arrived late Saturday in rebel-held territory in Idlib province where they were greeted with embraces and shots fired into the air. It was not immediately clear whether further evacuations were taking place on Sunday. The evacuation deal was brokered by Qatar a longtime supporter of Syrian opposition forces and Iran a key regime ally. Shiite-dominated Iran has repeatedly raised concerns for the residents of Fuaa and Kafraya who are mainly Shiites and were besieged by Sunni rebels.

Syrian rescue workers of the Civil Defence said that they had taken away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between the warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. Syrias main armed opposition condemned the bombing with groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army describing it as a ""treacherous terrorist attack"". Pope Francis in an Easter message also condemned the attack describing it as ""ignoble"" and asking God to bring healing and comfort to what he called the ""beloved and martyred Syria"". The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies.

The agreement had stalled leaving thousands of people from both government-besieged and rebel-besieged areas stranded at two transit points on the citys outskirts before the explosion occurred. Pro-Damascus media outlets said a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb and killed at least 22 people. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was at least 24. Footage on state TV showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and vehicles in flames. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts. The vehicles had been waiting since Friday to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself. The convoy was carrying residents and pro-government fighters from the rebel-besieged Shia villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in nearby Idlib province. They had left under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families were granted safe passage from Madaya a government-besieged town near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to the opposition stronghold of Idlib province. People waiting in the Ramousah garage heard the blast and said they feared revenge attacks by pro-government forces. They circulated a statement on social media imploring ""international organizations"" to intervene so the situation did not escalate. The evacuation deal is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The deals are unpopular with the Syrian opposition who say they amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. They are also causing demographic changes because those who are displaced are usually Sunni Muslims like most of the opposition. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect and is supported by Shia regional allies. It was unclear who carried out Saturdays bombing attack. The exact reasons for the delay in completing the evacuation deal were also unclear. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. FORCED DISPLACEMENT A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shia villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. ""After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua"" Mehdi Tahhan said. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave"" he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Other evacuation deals in recent months have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assads Alawite religious minority is often considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shia fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict.

1923848146,Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory,"Tuesday 4 Apr 2017 Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory Reuters A suspected gas attack believed to be by Syrian government jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children under the age of eight in the northwestern province of Idlib on Tuesday a war monitor and medical workers in the rebel-held area said. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war monitoring group. ""This morning at 630 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine"" said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. ""Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people"" he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military Denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army ""has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place"" the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population Ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. U.S. air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where jihadists have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.",ahram,4/4/2017,idlib,0

Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. ""This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces"" Captain Jeff Davis said. ""We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened."" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"".

IS in a statement published on Twitter and the messaging service Telegram said a suicide bomber detonated an explosive belt among rebels ""getting ready to fight the Islamic State"". The blast on Sunday night struck the Atme border crossing between Turkey and the northern Syrian province of Idlib according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitoring group said the anti-regime fighters were travelling by bus to Turkey then back into Syria towards the rebel bastion of Azaz in Aleppo province. The attack killed 32 rebels as they were entering Turkey the Britain-based Observatory said updating an earlier toll on Sunday evening of 15. Its head Rami Abdel Rahman said the toll could rise further as other fighters remained critically wounded. ISs statement said the attack left ""nearly 50"" rebels dead charging they took orders from the US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria. IS has tried to advance on rebel territory in Aleppo province - particularly the towns of Azaz and nearby Marea - for several months. A major militant offensive in May saw IS encircle Marea but rebels pushed back the assault the following month after receiving ammunition from the coalition.

1923848151,Warplanes pound Syrias Idlib as battles rage in Aleppo,"Sunday 14 Aug 2016 Warplanes pound Syrias Idlib as battles rage in Aleppo AP Syrias rebel-held northwestern Idlib province came under heavy bombardment Sunday activists reported as rebels and pro-government forces battled for control of the nearby city of Aleppo. Much of the fighting has been marked by indiscriminate shelling missile attacks and aerial bombardment killing scores of civilians across Idlib and Aleppo. The rebels do not have an air force. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since rebels launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory which monitors both sides of the conflict and gathers information from a network of activists inside Syria. The toll includes 126 people killed by rebel shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo once Syrias largest city and commercial capital is now the focal point of the civil war and the only major city where the opposition to President Bashar Assad still has a foothold. The rebel campaign spearheaded by ultraconservative factions including the al-Qaida-linked Jaish Fatah al-Sham formerly known as the Nusra Front has drawn manpower from Idlib some 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the west. A spokesman for the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham faction confirmed that the rebels were drawing recruits from Idlib. ""The battle for Aleppo concerns all of Syria"" said Abu Khaled who gave only his nom de guerre. At least 97 rebel fighters from Idlib have died in combat in Aleppo since July 31 according to Abdurrahman. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. On Sunday evening rebels opened a new front sending a truck bomb into the western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. To the east a Kurdish-led force known as the Syria Democratic Forces drove the Islamic State group out of the strategic town of Manbij on Saturday and announced a new campaign against al-Bab a nearby town held by the extremists. The U.S. has provided the SDF with air cover and American special forces are advising them on the ground. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on IS near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Elsewhere in Syria rebels and government forces battled around a major power plant in the central Hama province. State media reported that rebels inflicted heavy damage to the Zaara generating station while an opposition media activist in the nearby town of Aqrab said the power plant was not targeted. Obeida al-Hamawi of the activist-run Hama Media Center said government forces had launched an assault from positions near the plant to retake the village of Zaara captured by rebels earlier this year. He said electricity was still being supplied to the area. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the area. In the south rockets set two apartment blocks on fire in a besieged opposition-held suburb of Damascus. The local council in Daraya accused the government of using incendiary weapons and posted videos showing volunteers transporting water tanks on tractors to help firefighters battle the blaze. The Observatory also reported a government rocket attack on the suburb. Following an international appeal the Syrian Arab Red Crescent evacuated a 10-year-old girl from the besieged Damascus suburb of Madaya to receive urgent care after activists say she was shot by a pro-government sniper on Aug. 2. Syrian state media said ""terrorists"" shot Ghinwa Qweider and then prevented her evacuation.

Fighting struck the southern edges of the battered city Wednesday night as opposition fighters and regime forces gear up for a major protracted battle that could mark a turning point in the five-year war. Syrian state news agency SANA said rebel fire on the regime-controlled district of Hamdaniyeh on Wednesday killed 13 people and wounded 25 others. Rocket attacks on another government-held neighbourhood killed one person and wounded 12 others earlier in the day. SANA said Russian and government planes targeted ""terrorist"" positions in the citys south as an AFP journalist in Aleppo said intense air strikes and artillery fire could be heard. But it was unclear if the major push for control of the city had begun. An estimated 1.2 million people live in zones controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo with about 250000 people in the rebel-held eastern districts. Residents across the city have been living in fear of competing sieges since fighting surged in late June over rival access routes into Aleppo. Russias military announced a three-hour daily halt of fighting starting on Thursday to allow humanitarian convoys to reach Aleppo but the UNs top aid official said it would not be enough.

""There are at least 56 dead including 11 children and dozens more wounded including some in critical condition"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said that the civilians were hit as they were fleeing fighting in the Aleppo province village of Al-Tukhar and that they had apparently been mistaken for IS group fighters. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Asked about the incident the coalition had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the reports. Al-Tukhar lies 14 kilometres (nine miles) north of the town of Manbij a key IS group stronghold that has been repeatedly targeted in raids by the US-led coalition. On Monday the Observatory said 21 civilians had been killed in coalition raids in the area 15 in a northern district of Manbij and another six in Al-Tukhar. Manbij sits on ISs main supply route between Syria and neighbouring Turkey and has been the target of a US-backed offensive by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters since May 31. In June the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance broke into western districts of the town but their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the jihadists and ongoing suicide attacks. Near Aleppo government forces sought to tighten their siege of rebel-held districts of the battleground second city. Clashes erupted around Handarat a largely deserted Palestinian refugee camp north of the city after government forces seized parts of the only remaining supply route into rebel-held eastern districts effectively severing them from the outside world. The capture of the Castello Road has raised fears of a lengthy siege of east Aleppo where residents have already reported food shortages and rising prices. The Observatory said fierce clashes were underway around Handarat Camp which is less than two kilometres (barely a mile) from the northern outskirts of the city. ""If the regime takes Handarat it will be able to completely asphyxiate the rebels in east Aleppo and they will be unable to launch counter-attacks to retake the Castello Road"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. Analysts have warned that the government advances around Aleppo could be ""devastating"" for the rebels. And the United Nations has raised concern about the fate of the more then 200000 people still living in rebel-held districts.

""Prominent figures in Jayrud have had a local truce with the regime for at least two years and neither fired on each other"" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. He said at least 31 people were killed including two medics. It was not immediately clear how many of the rest were civilians. Activists in the town said the head of the local medical centre and several colleagues were killed. ""There have been at least 45 air strikes today. The towns medical centre was hit and its director Amjad al-Danaf was killed"" activist Abu Malek al-Jayrudi told AFP via the Internet. He said the town is home to some 60000 people and that the bombardment had not stopped since early Saturday. Rebel groups in Jayrud include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Jaish al-Islam spokesman Islam Alloush said on Friday that Al-Nusra Front had executed the air force pilot. Several government aircraft have been shot down by rebels or crashed because of technical faults since the civil war erupted five years ago. According to the Observatory three Syrian officers were killed on Friday when their helicopter crashed in the south near territory held by the Islamic State jihadist group. Abdel Rahman said government forces had managed to recover the bodies of the victims of the crash the cause of which remained unclear. ""We dont know if it was a technical issue or not but the bodies are with the regime"" Abdel Rahman said. Dozens of local truces have been brokered between the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias increasingly complex civil war. But a nationwide ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by Moscow and Washington in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides. US officials have accused Russia of not doing enough to rein in its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow has countered that rebel groups that have failed to break ranks with Al-Qaeda and continue to fight alongside it are legitimate targets.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deaths came in three separate clashes around the town in Aleppo province of northern Syria. At least 22 of the jihadists were killed in fighting on the border between Aleppo and Raqa province where IS has its de-facto capital.

The blasts sent a massive ball of fire into the sky causing widespread damage and panic among residents many of whom are supporters of President Bashar Assad. One resident said the explosions were so strong they cracked the walls of some buildings. Thick smoke and dust could be seen from a distance as explosions shook the ground. A video posted online by activists showed a huge ball of fire over Homs neighborhoods. The explosions in Homs reflected the see-saw nature of the conflict. It showed that despite significant advances by Assads military rebels could still strike back. An official at the governors office in Homs said about 10 rockets slammed into the neighborhood of Zahra and the nearby sports stadium sparking a large fire and causing several casualties. He said the explosions caused massive destruction and wounded at least 130 people. He didnt offer a number for those killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations. He did not give a casualty figure. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which closely monitors the fighting in Syria said 40 people were killed and 120 were wounded some critically when rockets struck an arms depot igniting the fire. A resident of Homs corroborated that account saying he heard blasts for more than an hour after the first explosion. He said they could be heard from the overwhelmingly pro-regime districts of Wadi Dahab and al-Walid where the regime is known to keep arms depots. ""Rockets were falling on the area ... when the arms depot began to explode but we dont know if the rockets triggered the blasts"" he said speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. He said the explosions were so strong that ""they shook parts of the city."" They also shattered all windows in the area and cracked walls he added. He said he spoke with Syrian Arab Red Crescent paramedics who told him that at least 22 bodies were taken to hospitals. The explosions in Homs coincided with a rare trip by President Bashar Assad to a former rebel bastion near the capital Damascus to mark Army Day. Assads visit to Daraya is his first known public trip outside the capital his seat of power in more than a year. He visited the battered Baba Amr district in the central city of Homs after troops seized it from rebels in March 2012. It also is the latest sign of confidence from Assad whose troops have been on the offensive and scored significant gains against rebels in recent months. Assad pledged victory over troops fighting to topple him. More than 100000 people have been killed since the uprising against the Assad familys four-decade rule began in March 2011.

The Syrian raids come as the United States carries out air strikes against the Islamic State just across the border in neighbouring Iraq. The US strikes are intended to limit the advance of IS militants who have seized large swathes of territory in both Iraq and Syria declaring an Islamic ""caliphate."" The group emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time Iraq affiliate but has since broken with that organisation and grown into a cross-border militant group. It has been battling rival opposition fighters in Syria since early January after a backlash because of the groups abuses against civilians and rebels and its bid to dominate captured territory.",ahram,8/5/2014,raqqa,1

Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed ""barrel bombs"" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared ""caliphate"" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias ""Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge"" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an ""existential threat"". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there ""living in appalling conditions"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. ""Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago"" it said.

The air force also hit jihadist targets in neighbouring Hasakeh province late Saturday the Observatory said. IS fighters have been battling both government troops and Kurdish militia in the northeastern province which has a large Kurdish population.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fate of around 200 other soldiers remained unknown as the IS assault forced the army to pull back late on Friday. The Division 17 base has fallen from army control but ""the jihadists have not moved into the site for fear of air strikes"" said the Britain-based groups director Rami Abdel Rahman. The IS lost at least 28 jihadist fighters he said.

Jihadist rebels blamed Russian warplanes of carrying out Mondays attack and said they would fight back against Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces and his Russian and Iranian backers in the six-year-old conflict. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three air strikes hit the market in Atareb west of Aleppo and killed at least 61 people. Atareb is inside what is known as a de-escalation zone under an agreement between Turkey Russia and Iran to reduce the bloodshed. But despite the diplomatic efforts fighting continues in many areas including Aleppo Idlib Raqqa Deir al-Zor and Hama. ""(The zones) did de-escalate fighting"" UN humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told Reuters. But lately ""there has been increased fighting also."" The zones were set up under the Astana process a series of talks in the capital of Kazakhstan between Russia and Iran and the rebels supporter Turkey. They agreed in September to deploy observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in Syrias Idlib province which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents. Following the air strikes the Tahrir al-Sham jihadist alliance denounced the ceasefire talks and pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear whether the strikes on rebel-held Atareb had been carried out by Syrian warplanes or those of Damascuss ally Russia. The monitor said three strikes hit the towns market adding that the overall toll was expected to rise because dozens of people had been wounded or were still missing after the attack. A photographer contributing to AFP saw massive destruction at the scene with rubble from damaged buildings covering the street and panicked civilians carrying away the injured. Three men helped one of those hit in the attack his face drenched in blood and his features almost completely obscured. Nearby the body of a man in a blue shirt and dark trousers lay where he had died. Civil defence workers rushed alongside civilians to evacuate the injured with one man in a thick beanie hat carrying a wailing child in a pink sweater away from the scene. Elsewhere the bodies of at least three children were laid out on the ground partly covered by thick bolts of fabric. Atareb is in the west of Aleppo province in an area that is part of a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed under a deal earlier this year between Syrias allies Russia and Iran and rebel backer Turkey.

The Syrian government its ally Russia and a US-led coalition have all carried out air strikes against IS in Raqa. The Observatory said there were fresh air strikes against the city on Wednesday one of which hit the town hall. It said those strikes appeared to have been carried out by the coalition. The coalition said it had carried out two strikes near Raqa on Monday hitting a bridge used by the jihadists as well as oil facilities. There are an estimated 300000 people still living in the city. Activists have accused IS of preventing civilians from leaving in order to use them as human shields against air strikes. Twin offensives aimed at severing ISs supply route to Raqa from the Turkish border have met fierce resistance from the jihadists in recent days. Near the border a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters has been encircling IS in the town of Manbij for days but has faced multiple suicide bombings by the jihadists.

More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar al-Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied. Heavy Bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the Observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the Observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The Observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control - Zeitan Khalsa and Barna - causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power. But the Syrian Observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies - who include members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias - were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the Observatory said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes on Al-Shaara a town held by the Islamic State (IS) group in Deir Ezzor province were suspected to have been carried out by either Russian or Syrian government planes. The death toll is likely to rise due to the serious condition of some of the wounded Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Residents from nearby villages typically flock to the Al-Shaara market to do their shopping Abdel Rahman said. Heavy air strikes hit IS group -held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Ezzor from early Monday he said. IS controls more than 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the oil-rich province of the same name most of which has been in its hands since 2013. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year-old conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the raids that also hit several neighbourhoods in Idlib and wounded at least 90 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor could not immediately confirm how many of the casualties were civilians saying some bodies ""were burned beyond recognition"". An AFP photographer in Idlib saw men clambering over rubble in just slippers or sandals to help evacuate wounded dust-covered residents and children from a collapsing building. Others tried to lift a bloodied shopper who had collapsed on the ground as a fire raged in a nearby open-air clothes market. A man his hand pressing a bloodied wound on his hand walked away clutching the hand of a barefooted boy. The raids also destroyed several shops and cars in the area. After marathon talks in Geneva US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a ceasefire would begin Monday the first day of the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha.

1923848279,Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo,"Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo AFP Sunday 30 Oct 2016 Syrias regime and rebels were locked in fierce fighting Sunday on Aleppos western edges where 38 civilians have been killed in a two-day opposition offensive to break the government siege. Rebels and allied militants launched a major offensive on Friday to break through government lines and reach the 250000 people living in the citys east. Since then they have unleashed a salvo of rockets artillery shells and car bombs around the western government-controlled districts. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the countrys five-year civil war which has killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage. ""Rebel fighters have launched hundreds of rockets and shells onto the western districts from positions inside the city and on its western edges"" said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two days of such heavy rebel bombardment have killed 38 civilians including 14 children and wounded another 250. Fighting has also killed 30 regime and allied fighters as well as 50 Syrian rebels according to the Observatory. The monitor did not have an immediate death toll for foreign anti-regime fighters many of whom have joined the militants factions. About 1500 rebels have massed on a 15-kilometre front along the western edges of Aleppo since Friday scoring quick gains in the Dahiyet al-Assad district but struggling to push east since then. ""The advance will be from Dahiyet al-Assad towards Hamdaniyeh"" said Yasser al-Youssef of the Noureddin al-Zinki rebel faction. Hamdaniyeh is a regime-held district directly adjacent to opposition-controlled eastern neighbourhoods. Fighting lasted all night and into Sunday with air strikes and artillery fire along the western battlefronts heard even in the eastern districts an AFP correspondent there said. Plumes of smoke could be seen snaking up from the citys skyline. A pro-regime military source told AFP that the rebel assault was ""massive and coordinated"" but insisted it was unable to break into any neighbourhoods besides Dahiyet al-Assad. ""Theyre using Grad missiles and car bombs and are supported by foreign fighters in their ranks"" he said. Those waging the assault include Aleppo rebels and reinforcements from Idlib province to the west among them the militant Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking ties with Al-Qaeda. Aleppos front line runs through the heart of the city dividing rebels in the east from government troops in the west. In late September government troops launched their own assault to recapture all of the eastern rebel-controlled territory. It was backed by fierce air strikes from Russia which launched its own air war in 2015 to back President Bashar al-Assads forces. That onslaught spurred massive international criticism of both Moscow and Damascus. Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian pause"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave Aleppos east but few did so. Moscow says it will continue a halt on air strikes over Aleppo in place since October 18. The Russian military said Friday it had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorization to resume the raids.

Rebel groups including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham faction and former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front fired waves of rockets into government-held western Aleppo killing at least 15 civilians a monitor said. The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia including the Hmeimim military base used by Russian forces allied with the regime. Moscow says it has not bombed Aleppo since October 18 but senior Russian military official Sergei Rudskoi told a briefing Friday that the military had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume its air strikes. ""We have appealed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with a request to resume air strikes"" Rudskoi said. But the Kremlin said Putin did not agree. ""The Russian president considers it inappropriate at the current moment to resume strikes on Aleppo"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said adding that Putin thought it was necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in the war-ravaged city. ""The Russian side retains the right in case of extreme necessity to use all the troops and facilities it has to carry out support of the Syrian armed forces at the necessary level"" he added. Fridays rebel assault comes more than three months into a government siege of eastern Aleppo where more than 250000 people live and several weeks after the army began an operation to retake the rebel east. Rebel groups ""announce the start of the battle to break the siege of Aleppo"" said Abu Yusef Muhajir a military commander and spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham. The assault ""will end the regime occupation of western Aleppo and break the siege on the people trapped inside"" he told AFP. ""The breaking of the siege is inevitable"" said Yasser al-Yusef a member of the political office of the Nureddine al-Zinki rebel group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said at least 15 civilians including a woman and two children had been killed and more than 100 wounded in rebel fire on western Aleppo. The monitor reported fierce clashes on multiple fronts on the western and southern outskirts of west Aleppo with three suicide car bombs targeting a checkpoint in the Dahiyet al-Assad neighbourhood. Fighting was continuing in the area near a military academy it said but had no immediate toll. An AFP correspondent in east Aleppo said the assault had boosted morale in rebel-held districts with mosques broadcasting ""God is greatest"" from loudspeakers. He said residents burned tyres to create smoke and provide cover against air attack. Heavy rain put the fires out but also hampered Syrian air operations creating what one rebel dubbed ""a divine no-fly zone"". The Observatory said rebels had also fired dozens of rockets at the Nairab military airport and Aleppo international airport both east of the city and government-controlled. Rebels also fired rockets from Idlib province into the government stronghold of Latakia killing one person and wounding six. Rockets struck close to the Hmeimim military airport as well as near President Bashar al-Assads ancestral village Qardaha the monitor said. State television said ""the army has foiled an attempt by terrorists to attack Aleppo city from several axes with suicide bomb attacks and has inflicted losses on them"". State news agency SANA said government planes were carrying out air strikes south and west of Aleppo. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012 and in September the army announced an operation to recapture the whole city.

Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian truce"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east. But few did so and a UN plan to evacuate the wounded failed because security could not be guaranteed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused UN agencies Friday of ""not being professional enough"" over Aleppo.

The report comes amid fierce clashes on the outskirts of Damascus between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant which is spearheading a major offensive in Iraq and rebels the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""ISIL executed eight men in Deir Hafer in the east of Aleppo province"" on Saturday because they belonged to rebel groups that had fought against the jihadists as well as Assads forces it said. ISIL then ""crucified them in the main square of the village where their bodies will remain for three days"" the Britain-based monitor said. Also in Aleppo province a ninth man was executed and crucified in Al-Bab town near the border with Turkey. ISIL first emerged in Syrias war in late spring last year and was initially welcomed by some Syrian rebels who believed its combat experience would help topple Assad. But subsequent jihadist abuses quickly turned the Syrian opposition including Islamists against ISIL. Rebels launched a major anti-ISIL offensive in January 2014 and have pushed them out of large swathes of Aleppo province and all of Idlib in the northwest. However ISIL remains firmly rooted in Raqa its northern Syrian headquarters and wields significant power in Deir Ezzor in the east near the border with Iraq. Activists say the groups Iraq offensive and capture of heavy weapons - some of them US-made - appears to have boosted its confidence in Syria. East of Damascus ""fierce clashes broke out early Sunday between rebels from the Army of Islam and ISIL near the town of Hammuriyeh"" the Observatory said. The Army of Islam is a major component of the Islamic Front Syrias largest rebel coalition which has been fighting ISIL for months but such fighting in Damascus province is unprecedented. Regime soldiers and warplanes backed by Lebanons Shiite Hezbollah also pounded rebel positions near the capital with rockets and surface-to-surface missiles said the Local Coordination Committees activist network. Syrias war began as a peaceful protest movement in March 2011 demanding political change but became an armed insurgency when Assads regime unleashed a brutal crackdown. Many months into the fighting jihadists began to flock to Syria where upwards of 162000 people have been killed and millions displaced in more than three years of conflict.",ahram,6/5/2014,aleppo,0

Syrian state television also reported the blast saying four people had been killed and 22 wounded in a ""terrorist explosion"" at the southern entrance of the city. In the northern province of Raqa two suicide bombers exploded inside base 17 an army base under siege by opposition forces according to the Observatory a Britain-based group that relies on activists and other witnesses inside Syria. The group said two fighters from the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had blown themselves up at the headquarters which is north of the groups stronghold in Raqas provincial capital. Clashes between regime forces and ISIL broke out after the blasts which the Observatory said killed several soldiers. In Damascus meanwhile the group said a man died after regime shelling a day earlier on the Palestinian Yarmuk camp where a ceasefire has broken down. The renewed fighting has halted aid delivery efforts to the besieged camp where two more people died from lack of food and medical care on Wednesday the Observatory said. Around 130 people are reported to have died because of shortages in the camp caused by the tight army siege. More than 140000 people are estimated to have been killed since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011.",ahram,3/4/2014,hama,0
1924058031,Israeli attack on Syria military camp kills three | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 232017 An Israeli attack on a Syrian training camp near the Golan Heights killed three members of a pro-government militia on Sunday an official from the forces said. The Al Fawwar camp in Syrias southwestern Quneitra province is used by the National Defence Forces (NDF) which command some 90000 fighters across Syria. The NDF official told AFP that two fighters were also wounded in the Israeli attack but said it was unclear whether the damage was inflicted by an air strike or shelling. Another Syrian source inside the training camp told AFP that around 600am local time (0300 GMT) ""security guards at the camp saw what looked like three fireballs coming towards the camp"". ""Then there were several consecutive blasts because of the explosion of ammunition warehouses"" that firefighters worked hard to extinguish the source said. The source also said that they were ""Israeli rockets"" but could not specify what kind of missiles may have been used. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the attack had targeted a ""weapons warehouse"" in the camp. Israels army declined to comment Sunday on the attack. On Friday the Israeli army said it targeted positions inside Syria in retaliation for mortar fire that hit the northern part of the Golan Heights. At the time Syrias official news agency SANA said Israel had struck a Syrian army position in the province of Quneitra on the Golan plateau ""causing damage"". The Syrian government labels rebel groups and militants fighting the regime as ""terrorists"" and accuses Israel of backing them. Israel seized 1200 square kilometres of the Golan from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Around 510 square kilometres of the Golan are under Syrian control. The two countries are still technically at war although the border remained largely quiet for decades until 2011 when the Syrian conflict broke out. The Israeli side is hit sporadically by what are usually deemed to be stray rounds and Israel has recently taken to opening fire in retaliation.",jordantimes,4/13/2017,quneitra,0
1924058032,Dozens dead as car bomb hits Syria evacuees | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 152017 A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the Daesh terror groups Raqqa stronghold. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when if ever they would be able to return to their homes.

1924058034,Strike kills 15 near Syrias Daesh-held Raqqa monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Apr 092017 At least 15 civilians including four children were killed in a suspected US-led coalition air strike on Saturday near the Daesh terror groups Syrian bastion Raqqa a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 17 people were injured in the strike on Heneyda and that the death toll could rise further because several of the wounded were in serious conditions. The Britain-based group said the strike was suspected to have been carried out by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Heneyda is around 25 kilometres west of the city of Raqqa the target of a major operation led by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters and backed by the US-led coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have for months been advancing towards the city in the north of the country hoping to encircle it before launching a final assault. Its forces last month seized the Tabaqa military airport from Daesh and have entered the complex of the key Tabqa dam after being airlifted behind jihadist lines by US forces. They continue to battle for the town of Tabqa around 40 kilometres west of Raqqa with clashes ongoing on Saturday the observatory said. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government demonstrations in March 2011.,jordantimes,4/14/2017,raqqa,1
1924058036,Outrage as Syria _chemical attack_ kills dozens in rebel-held town | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 052017 KHAN SHEIKHUN Syria A suspected chemical attack in rebel-held northwestern Syria killed dozens of civilians including children and left many more sick and gasping on Tuesday causing widespread outrage. The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming ""terrorist groups"" for using ""chemical and toxic substances"". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a ""reprehensible"" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was ""confident in its assessment"" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the ""best interest"" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a ""clear identification of responsibilities and accountability"". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released ""toxic gas"". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters. I call on the Security Council members who have previously used their vetoes to defend the indefensible to change their course.",jordantimes,4/15/2017,idlib,1
1924058037,Five dead as Russian military helicopter downed in Syria | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Aug 012016 BEIRUT A Russian military helicopter was shot down over Syria on Monday killing all five people on board in the single deadliest incident for Moscow since it intervened in the war. The attack came as Syrian opposition fighters and their allies battled government forces outside Aleppo in a bid to ease the regimes siege of rebel-held parts of the northern city. Russias defence ministry announced the downing of the helicopter which it said was carrying three crew and two officers. ""A Russian Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down from the ground after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo"" the defence ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies. The Kremlin said all five people on board were assumed dead. ""As far as we know from the information weve had from the defence ministry those in the helicopter died they died heroically because they were trying to move the aircraft away to minimise victims on the ground"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy called the downing a ""terrorist act"" and said the defence ministry was still trying to confirm the fate of the Russian servicemen ""through all possible channels"". It was not immediately clear who was responsible. The incident was the deadliest single attack on Russian forces in Syria since Moscow began its intervention in support of President Bashar Assads government last September. It brought the total number of members of the Russian forces killed in Syria to 18. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo. Idlib is held almost entirely by a powerful coalition of Islamist and jihadist forces including the former Al Nusra Front now known as the Fateh Al Sham Front after renouncing its status as Al Qaedas Syrian affiliate. Aleppo rebel assault In neighbouring Aleppo province the Fateh Al Sham Front and allied rebel groups were fighting fierce battles on Monday against regime troops on the outskirts of Aleppo city. The clashes are part of an assault launched Sunday to try to ease a government siege of the rebel-held east of the city. The observatory said the rebels had advanced overnight south and southwest of Aleppo but reported ongoing fighting as well as government air strikes on the battlefield and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks government forces have encircled the east cutting the sole supply route in and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis for the estimated 250000 people now under siege there. The primary goal of the rebel assault is to seize the Ramussa neighbourhood on the citys southern outskirts. The road that runs through Ramussa is the main supply route for regime forces going to the areas they control in western Aleppo said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. It is also used by civilians to enter and leave government-controlled districts of Aleppo. Taking a detour from the north would be too dangerous he added. Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham said on Twitter it was involved in fierce clashes near Ramussa and advancing towards the route. State news agency SANA said rebel rocket and sniper fire near Ramussa on Monday killed four people including three women. The observatory put the toll at six dead. Humanitarian corridors SANA said people were using the route as usual but residents of western Aleppo expressed fears that the assault could cut them off. If the militants break the siege they will besiege us and cut the Khanasser route which is the only artery we have said Hossam Qassab a 32-year-old pharmacist. A Syrian security source acknowledged the assault but said government forces had repelled it. The encirclement of eastern Aleppo has raised fears of starvation for remaining residents who have reported food shortages and spiralling prices since the government siege began on July 17. Last week Moscow announced the opening of humanitarian corridors from the east into government territory for civilians and surrendering rebels. On Saturday Moscow and Syrian official media reported dozens of civilians had fled via these corridors but residents and rebels on the ground dismissed the reports as lies. Elsewhere in Aleppo province the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance advanced inside the Daesh terror group bastion of Manbij on Monday the observatory reported. The SDF hold approximately 40 per cent of the town and are fighting to take it with support from the US-led coalition against Daesh.",jordantimes,8/19/2016,aleppo,1
1924058038,Dozens dead as warplanes pound rebel-held north Syria | Jordan Times,Last updated at Aug 142016 Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province.

1924058042,At least 70 killed in north of Syria_s Aleppo _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas.

1924058046,Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 282016 QAMISHLI Syria A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.,jordantimes,7/19/2016,hasakeh,1

The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. ""The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege"" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to ""join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries"" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.",jordantimes,7/13/2016,aleppo,1
1924058050,13 civilians killed in regime air raids on northern Syria | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 152015 A member of the Syrian regime forces runs near destroyed buildings in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakeh on Monday (AFP photo) BEIRUT Thirteen civilians among them seven children were killed in aerial attacks by Syrias government Wednesday on the northern province of Aleppo a monitoring group said. A woman and her three children as well as another child were killed when helicopters dropped a barrel bomb on the village of Taduf said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Taduf which lies in the northeast of Syrias Aleppo province is controlled by the Daesh terror group. In the provinces west eight civilians including three children were killed when regime warplanes struck the village of Daret Izza held by Islamist fighters and other rebels. Regime forces are continuing to kill civilians through aerial attacks with barrel bombs or shells indifferent to the international resolutions on this matter said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said the attacks amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by regime forces on a daily basis. Abdel Rahman told AFP the bombing campaign was an effort by the regime to turn civilians against the opposition factions or against IS with the reasoning that the aerial attacks are a result of the presence of fighters inside their towns and villages. The regime has stepped up air attacks in Aleppo province in recent days killing at least 57 civilians when it dropped container bombs on the Daesh-held town of Al Bab at the weekend. Also Wednesday 22 Daesh fighters were killed when regime warplanes struck a convoy traveling between the provinces of Deir Ezzor in the east and Hasakeh in the northeast. According to the observatory the jihadists were all Syrians from Deir Ezzor.,jordantimes,7/15/2015,aleppo,1
1924058051,Barrel bombs kill 11 civilians in Daesh town in Syria | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jul 172015 Barrel bombs dropped from Syrian government helicopters on Thursday killed at least 11 civilians including three children in raids on a jihadist-held northern town a monitoring group said. The crudely constructed weapons were used on Al Bab which lies in Aleppo province and is held by the extremist Daesj group according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Since Saturday at least 68 civilians have been killed in aerial attacks on the town. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said the ""intensified air attacks by regime forces on Al Bab are aimed at foiling Daesh efforts on multiple fronts"" including the nearby Kweyris military airport which Daesh has besieged for more than a year. Al Bab is strategically important because it is one of Daeshs closest positions to regime-held parts of Aleppo he told AFP. In May more than 60 civilians were killed by barrel bomb attacks on the town. Syrias embattled regime has heavily bombarded areas in Aleppo province that have fallen out of its control. To the west in Idlib province an alliance of rebels and Islamist fighters heavily shelled the provinces last two regime-held Shiite villages for the second consecutive day. The Army of Conquest an opposition coalition that includes Al Qaedas Syria affiliate Al Nusra Front began its assault on Fuaa and Kafraya on Wednesday. ""Dozens of shells fell overnight Wednesday and into Thursday morning on Fuaa and Kafraya which are largely inhabited by Shiite Muslims"" the observatory said. Abdel Rahman said there were casualties but had no immediate toll. The Army of Conquest said Wednesday its attack was a response to an offensive by the army and the Lebanese Shiite movement Hizbollah on Zabadani the last rebel-held bastion along the Syrian-Lebanese border. Clashes in Zabadani raged on Thursday according to the observatory which has documented heavy shelling on the town since early July. Elsewhere on Thursday the observatory said 17 government troops including a commander were killed in fighting with the Daesh group near the city of Palmyra. Among the dead was Major General Mohsen Makhlouf of a tank battalion in area of central Homs province the monitor said. Palmyra which is famed for its ancient ruins has been under Daesh control since May but in recent weeks government troops have advanced to within a few kilometres of the city. In northeastern Syria Kurdish forces backed by government shelling took an area south of the city of Hasakeh from Daesh forces the observatory said. Daesh entered the city where security control is divided between Kurdish and regime forces on June 25 seizing territory in its southern districts. But the Kurdish fighters along with a group of Sunni Arab tribesman are hoping to encircle the Daesh forces by taking a strip of territory outside the city. At least 230000 people have been killed in Syrias multi-front conflict which began in 2011 with anti-government protests but devolved into a civil war.",jordantimes,7/19/2015,aleppo,0
1924058052,Syria regime air strikes kill at least 39 _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jan 202015 Beirut Syrian government air strikes on Tuesday killed at least 39 people more than half of them civilians in two main battlegrounds in the north of the country a monitor said. ""The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the deaths of at least 27 people... in air strikes targeting the outskirts of Tal Hamis"" said the Britain-based organisation. Speaking to AFP Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said nine of those killed had been identified by his group as civilians. ""More of the dead may be civilians too but we have not yet been able to confirm that"" Abdel Rahman said. He added that Tal Hamis situated in Hasakeh province which borders Iraq and which is home to a sizeable Kurdish population is under the control of the Islamic State jihadist group. Tuesdays bombing was especially deadly because it struck a cattle market. ""Some of the bodies were so mutilated by the strikes that people couldnt tell the human from the animal remains"" said Abdel Rahman. Earlier Tuesday the Observatory reported a string of air strikes against the town of Saraqeb and the village of Sheikh Mustafa in the northwestern province of Idlib. Eleven civilians were killed in Saraqeb and another man died in Sheikh Mustafa according to the group which relies on a broad network of activists and doctors for its reports. Both towns are under jihadist control though all of Tuesdays casualties there were civilians. Most of Idlibs countryside is out of government control but its capital remains in regime hands. In November Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front expelled Western-backed rebels from their Idlib positions. The provinces countryside was among the first areas the government lost in the nearly four year conflict. The conflict began when forces loyal to President Bashar Al Assad launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful pro-reform protests in March 2011 that triggered a complex multi-sided civil war. It has cost the lives of more than 200000 people and forced half the countrys population to flee their homes.",jordantimes,1/19/2015,hasakeh,1
1924058053,Syria air strikes kill at least 44 _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Feb 022015 Beirut Syrian government air strikes on opposition-held towns across the country killed at least 44 people on Monday and wounded more than 100 a monitoring group said. In Jassem in the southern province of Daraa 16 civilians were killed in four air strikes while 25 were wounded said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes came in response to a major rebel offensive that has been under way in southern Syria for months. ""As usual the regime is striking populated areas in order to make civilian supporters of opposition fighters turn against them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar Assad have suffered a spate of defeats at the hands of his forces but they still have the upper hand in Daraa. ""Opposition fighters are making steady progress in Daraa province. The vast majority of the west of the province has completely fallen out of government control and that is where Jassem is located"" Abdel Rahman said. Rebels in the area benefit from ""the fact that supply lines from Jordan are still open"" he added. The involvement of experienced fighters from Syrias Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front has also helped the rebels to gain territory in Daraa. Elsewhere air strikes on Douma the besieged rebel-held town east of Damascus killed at least 10 civilians and wounded dozens more the observatory said. An AFP photographer in Douma said the strikes hit residential areas and that most of the wounded were children. Defector killed At Khan Sheikhun in the northwestern province of Idlib 15 people were killed including a former army officer who had defected from loyalist ranks to join opposition forces the observatory said. Another three people were killed in strikes elsewhere in Syria one in Aleppo province a second in Damascus province and a third in Busra Al Sham in Daraa province. The regime first deployed warplanes in the Syrian conflict in July 2012. Now nearly four years into the war there are air strikes every day despite repeated warnings from the international community that such tactics fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets. On a separate front Syrian Kurds fighting the IS group made fresh advances near Kobani seizing a new string of villages a week after the flashpoint town was recaptured from the IS jihadists. The Kurds now control an area stretching across 14 kilometres southwards from Kobani 10 kilometres to the east and 10 to 12 kilometres to the west said Abdel Rahman. The Observatory director also said Kurdish Peoples Protection Units backed by Syrian rebels had killed 10 IS members in the past 24 hours. The US-led coalition targeting the jihadists in both Syria and Iraq reported Monday it had launched 10 air strikes against IS in Syria nine near Kobani and one at Deir Ezzor in the east. Another 17 strikes targeted the jihadists in neighbouring Iraq the Pentagon said. The Syrian conflict began as a peaceful uprising in March 2011 but escalated into a civil war after the government unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent. More than 200000 people have been killed since then and nearly half of the population has fled their homes.",jordantimes,2/19/2015,daraa,0
1924058055,Syria regime air strikes kill 15 near Damascus _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Feb 092015 BEIRUT At least 15 people were killed and dozens wounded on Monday in government air strikes on an area outside the capital Damascus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. There were no immediate details on the breakdown of those killed in the strikes which are the latest to hit the town of Douma in the rebel stronghold of Eastern Ghouta. At a field clinic in the area an AFP photographer saw a girl in a purple headscarf and another child in a woolly hat crying as doctors treated the wounded among them a young boy. His eyes stared wide in apparent shock from a face streaked with blood and white dust. His arm was bandaged and attached to a rudimentary drip. In the streets outside locals picked through rubble carrying the wounded to the clinic while a civil defence worker trained a hose on a fire set by the strikes. The opposition bastion east of Damascus was still reeling from a massive government aerial assault on Thursday that came after rebels fired more than 120 rockets and mortar rounds into the capital. The rebel barrage killed 10 people in Damascus including a child while the government air strikes and surface-to-surface missiles fired at Eastern Ghouta killed at least 82 people among them 18 children. Eastern Ghouta has been under government siege for nearly two years as the army tries to break the rebel hold over the area. The siege has created medical and food shortages exacerbating dire humanitarian needs created by regular government bombardment of the area.

1924058056,Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 282016 A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.,jordantimes,7/22/2016,hasakeh,0
1924058058,At least 70 killed in north of Syrias Aleppo monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas.

1924058059,Syria rebels kill 7 in Aleppo assault capture 3 villages _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jun 182016 BEIRUT At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies who include members of the Lebanese group Hizbollah and other Iranian-backed militias were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front which like the Daesh terror group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.,jordantimes,6/15/2016,aleppo,1

Five children were among those killed in the air raids on Idlib which is held by Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front and its allies the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Peace talks towards ending Syrias five-year war have stalled with no immediate end in sight to a conflict that has killed 280000 people. It was not clear who carried out the Idlib strikes but the observatory has reported previous air raids by the regime and its Russian ally on Idlib province which is also controlled by Al Nusra and rebel allies. Footage the observatory said was filmed after the Idlib strikes showed emergency workers training water hoses on a tall building amid a haze of smoke. In Maaret Al Numan an area south of the provincial capital unidentified warplanes also killed at least six civilians including a woman and her four children the observatory said. Russia launched air strikes in support of the Damascus regime in September allowing forces loyal to President Bashar Assad to advance against the rebels and Daesh. The Britain-based observatory relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria for its information. It says it determines what aircraft carried out raids based on their location flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. The observatory said Russian air strikes killed 23 civilians in strikes on Idlib city on May 31 but Russia denied carrying out raids there that day. Suspected government strikes killed at least 37 civilians in Maaret Al Numan in April sparking condemnation from Syrias opposition amid faltering peace talks Civilians flee Daesh bastion Meanwhile hundreds of civilians escaped the Daesh stronghold of Manbij in nearby Aleppo province on Sunday helped by a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance surrounding the town. Tens of thousands had been trapped inside Manbij after the alliance encircled the town on Friday in a major blow to the terrorist group controlling it. Around 600 civilians fled on foot towards areas held by the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance south of the town observatory Chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The SDF transported them to safer areas. Those still inside the town were terrified by heavy air strikes in the area Abdel Rahman said and food was becoming scarce after the SDF alliance blocked all roads in and out. At least 223 Daesh fighters and 28 SDF troops had been killed as well as 41 civilians in coalition air raids since the alliance offensive against Manbij began on May 31 according to the Observatory. Manbij lies at the heart of the last stretch of Daesh-controlled territory along Turkeys border. The siege has severed a key Daesh supply route that had channelled money and weapons from the Turkish border to the groups de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city. Daesh has come under attack on several fronts since declaring a cross-border caliphate in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Millions of people have been displaced since Syrias civil war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

Dozens of Daesh militants early on Monday attacked government positions south of the town of Tabaqa a Daesh stronghold on the Euphrates River said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said fierce clashes broke out but that regime forces were able to maintain their positions and were still 15 kilometres from the Daesh-held Tabaqa airport. ""Eleven regime fighters and 17 Daesh fighters were killed in the attack"" said Abdel Rahman. Earlier this month government fighters backed by Russian air power began pushing north towards Tabaqa held by Daesh since 2014. The town lies some 50 kilometres east of the extremist groups Syrian de facto capital of Raqqa city and recapturing it would sever the supply road from the west. Last week Daesh militants had sent reinforcements of fighters and weapons into Tabaqa in anticipation of a fierce battle to defend the town. Abdel Rahman said a total of 37 government fighters and 101 Daesh militants have been killed since the regime launched its offensive for Tabaqa. The war in Syria which began with the brutal repression of anti-government demonstrations in 2011 has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions.

1924058063,Syrian and Russian aircraft step up bombing of Aleppo city _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jun 062016 AMMAN Nearly 50 air strikes hit rebel-held areas in and around the Syrian city of Aleppo on Sunday in some of the heaviest recent raids by Russian and Syrian government aircraft residents and a monitoring group said. The group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said an unidentified war plane had crashed in countryside south of Aleppo in an area where Islamist rebel fighters are battling the Syrian army and Iranian-backed forces. It had no information on what caused the crash. A civil defence worker said at least 32 people were killed in the rebel-held parts of the city during the air strikes with 18 bodies pulled from flattened buildings in the Qatrji neighbourhood the worst hit. The monitor said dozens of barrel bombs oil drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel were dropped by helicopter on densely populated districts. ""This week-long campaign of bombing is very intense and day by day its getting worse... it is the worst we have seen in a while"" said Bebars Mishal a civil defence official in rebel-held Aleppo. For their part rebels hit government-held areas of Aleppo in what Syrian media said was an escalation of mortar attacks on the western districts. State media said attacks on Sunday on Hamadaniyah Midan and other neighbourhoods by insurgents killed at least 20 people in the second day of intense shelling of government-held areas. The death toll over the whole weekend was at least 44. Aleppo the countrys largest city before the war has been divided for years between rebel and government-held zones. Full control of Aleppo would be a huge prize for President Bashar Assad. Russias military intervention since September has helped to bolster Assads government. In the northwestern province of Idlib meanwhile residents said Syrian and Russian jets bombed the rebel-held provincial capital setting fire to a bustling market in the heart of the city. More than 30 people were injured at least three killed and dozens were unaccounted for according to an activist contacted in the city. The Idlib strikes came just days after some of the heaviest raids on residential areas for months killing more than 30 people and injuring dozens on May 31. Idlib has been a relative haven for thousands of displaced Syrians. The air raids in Aleppo on Sunday came in the wake of strikes on civilian areas on Friday that residents said were the most intense in over a month. The Syrian Observatory said the Syrian government raids had targeted the main Castello road that leads into rebel-held Aleppo as part of a campaign to complete the encirclement of the citys insurgent-dominated areas. A Russian defence ministry statement on Sunday accused militant Syrian rebel groups of firing mortars on the mainly Kurdish-populated Sheikh Maqsood neighbourhood in Aleppo that overlooks the Castello road. The monitor said 13 people including six children were killed on Saturday in the Kurdish-run area by insurgents mortars. Rebels accuse the powerful Kurdish YPG of working with the Syrian army to cut the main artery by intensifying their ground attacks on the highway. The Russians had on Saturday accused militants from radical Islamic groups of bringing at least 1000 fighters into an area in the southern Aleppo countryside. The militants have consolidated gains since Friday in the area around the strategic town of Khan Touman rebels say. The Nusra Front spearheaded an attack on Khan Touman last month delivering one of the biggest battlefield setbacks yet to a coalition of foreign Shiite fighters supporting Syrian government forces. Rebels say Russian jets on Sunday pounded insurgent positions in the area to prevent them from advancing towards the nearby town of Hader which rebels say is a stronghold of Iranian-backed militias. Also US-backed forces on Sunday engaged with the Daesh terror groups militants in an offensive that began last Tuesday against the group-held areas in Aleppo province beginning with the Manbij area where they continued to seize more villages according to Kurdish sources and the monitor.",jordantimes,6/22/2016,aleppo,1

A team of first responders the Syrian Civil Defence in Idlib said 22 people were killed and at least 50 wounded in the raids on the village of Hass. Most of those killed were children the group said in a post on its Facebook page. Another activist group the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave the same death toll and said 14 children and a woman were among those killed. The activist-operated Idlib News network which gave a lower toll of 17 people killed said the strikes hit as the children were gathered outside the school complex. It said the death toll could rise as some of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition the network added. Idlib is the main Syrian opposition stronghold though radical groups also have a large presence there. It has regularly been hit by Syrian and Russian warplanes as well as the US-led coalition targeting Daesh militants. Footage posted by activists online shows a huge plume of smoke rising from the area of the strikes and rescuers rushing casualties away along a dusty road lined with destroyed buildings. A womans body is seen being carried on a stretcher while other bodies covered in cloth and one with only a hat lie under shrubs and other casualties are ferried away in pick-up trucks. An activist at the scene Muaz Al Shami said as many as 10 air strikes were believed to have hit the residential area. The video content couldnt be independently confirmed. However it conforms with AP reporting on the events depicted. Earlier in the day the northern Aleppo province saw a new escalation as a helicopter believed to belong to Syrian government forces dropped barrel bombs in a deadly attack on Turkey-backed opposition forces in the border area Turkish officials said. A statement attributed to the field commander of Syrias pro-government troops said any Turkish advances in northern Syria under the pretext of fighting Daesh militants would be dealt with forcefully and appropriately. The barrel bombing was said to have occurred in the village of Tal Madiq in a part of northern Aleppo where rival groups have been operating mostly to rout Daesh militants. If confirmed it would be the first attack by Syrian government forces on the Turkish-backed fighters. Turkeys state-run news agency didnt say when the attack occurred and said at least two Syrian opposition fighters were killed and five others wounded. A Syrian opposition spokesman said it took place Tuesday. The observatorys chief Rami Abdurrahman said helicopters struck as intense clashes were underway between Kurdish-led fighters and Turkey-backed forces in Tal Madiq and that 11 Syrian opposition fighters and five Kurdish fighters were killed. The Kurdish-led forces are now in control of the village about 16 kilometres from the highly prized Daesh-controlled town of Al Bab. A senior Kurdish commander however denied Syrian government bombings of the Turkey-backed fighters saying it was an attempted explanation for battlefield losses. They are trying to find a pretext for the loss. No aircraft were involved Mahmoud Barkhadan of the main Syria Kurdish militia the Peoples Protection Units told The Associated Press by telephone from the region. A spokesman for the Syrian fighting group Nour El Din El Zinki Yasser Al Youssef said the Kurdish-led forces attacked them while they were fighting Daesh militants in the area. Then Syrian government helicopters followed he said in a message. The complex terrain is a powder keg where confrontation among rival groups can break out anytime US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and Turkey. Ankara sent tanks troops and aircraft into northern Syria in August in an unprecedented incursion that it said was part of efforts to help Syrian opposition clear the border area of Daesh militants. But Ankara is also seeking to contain the US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Daesh putting it at odds with its key ally the United States. Ankara sees Kurdish fighters in Syria as an extension of its outlawed Kurdish militants and designated as a terrorist organisation. Syrias military threatened last week to shoot down any Turkish warplane that enters Syrian air space after Turkish jets raided villages in northern Syria in an escalation of Ankaras offensive against Kurdish fighters. On Wednesday a statement attributed to the field commander of pro-government troops said Turkish advance under the pretext of fighting Daesh in northern and eastern Aleppo is an encroachment on the Syrian governments area of operations and would not be tolerated. The fall of Al Bab to Turkey-backed rebels would threaten the governments siege on the rebels in the city of Aleppo to the west. Meanwhile Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters that Turkey is determined to push ahead with the offensive in northern Syria dubbed Operation Eurphrates Shield and capture Al Bab from Daesh militants. It would not be deterred by the bombing of Tal Madiq he said. Such attacks will not stop us from combatting Daesh Cavusoglu said. The Euphrates Shield operation will continue. The only goal of the Euphrates Shield operation is to clear Daesh from this area.,jordantimes,10/7/2016,idlib,1
1924058065,Syrian government push for Damascus rebel enclave kills at least 23 | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Nov 272017 BEIRUT An intensifying push by the Syrian government and allied forces to take the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus killed at least 23 people on Sunday and injured many the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group said at least 127 people including 30 children have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army backed by Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Eastern Ghouta is one of several ""de-escalation"" zones across western Syria where Russia has brokered deals to ease the fighting between rebels and President Bashar Assads government. A Reuters witness said there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning and warplanes had heavily bombarded the towns of Mesraba and Harasta. Heavy shelling also hit Eastern Ghouta and dozens had been injured. Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2012 and the area is suffering a humanitarian crisis. Ghouta residents are so short of food that they are eating trash fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days the UN World Food Programme said in a report this week. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week the escalating bombardment was forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. A number of shells from the rebel enclave have hit government-held Damascus in the past two weeks. Syrias six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War II. UN-backed peace negotiations are due to begin in Geneva on November 28. Several previous rounds of Geneva talks have failed to agree a political transition for Syria or a way to stop the violence. Yahya Aridi spokesman for the Syrian opposition Geneva delegation said on Sunday it was now time for the Syrian government and the opposition to ""get to the table and start talking about transition from dictatorship to freedom"" in Geneva.",jordantimes,11/16/2017,damascus,1
1924058066,Air strikes kill 4 in Syria _truce zone_ _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Nov 022017 BEIRUT Syrian government air strikes killed at least four civilians including a child in a rebel-held town in a de-escalation zone outside the capital Damascus on Thursday a monitor said. The strikes hit the town of Douma which lies in the Eastern Ghouta region where a truce deal agreed by regime allies Iran and Russia and rebel backer Turkey has been in place since July. Despite the deal there has been an uptick in government bombardment of the area in recent days. Humanitarian groups have also warned of a malnutrition crisis in the area which is under a tight government siege. Regime planes fired rockets on several parts of Douma said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor. Four civilians were killed including a child he said adding that 21 others were wounded. An AFP photographer saw some of the wounded being treated at a local medical facility where some of the dead were also being received. Ziad 13 suffered a head injury after being caught up in the strike on his way home. I was coming back from school when the first strike hit and I hid in a doorway he told AFP. The plane came back a second time and I tried to get down to the basement but the force of the second strike knocked the door closed and it injured my head and nose. Up to 400000 people are believed to live in Eastern Ghouta which has been under government siege since 2013. The blockade has caused serious food and medicine shortages and pushed the prices for what remains beyond the reach of impoverished residents. At least two children are reported to have died from malnourishment or related complications in recent weeks and more than 1100 other children are reportedly suffering acute malnutrition. On Monday several dozen trucks carrying assistance for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta as part of a United Nations-Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy. It was the first aid access since September despite repeated requests from the UN and humanitarian actors for consistent access to besieged areas like Eastern Ghouta. On Tuesday 11 people including six school children were killed in regime shelling on the town of Jisreen in Eastern Ghouta the observatory said. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.,jordantimes,11/2/2017,damascus,1
1924058067,Syria regime bombardment kills 4 schoolchildren in besieged enclave | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Nov 012017 JISREEN Syria At least four schoolchildren were among eight people killed in Syrian regime shelling in Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday despite a ceasefire in the hunger-hit rebel enclave outside Damascus. The bombardment came as a fresh round of peace talks to end Syrias six-year war entered a second day in the Kazakh capital Astana. Government fire on the besieged region has been on the rise for the past week with the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor saying the latest shelling hit a school in the town of Jisreen. ""A shell fired by regime troops hit the entrance of a school in Jisreen just as children were leaving it killing five people including four schoolchildren"" observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. A medical source at the town hospital confirmed the death toll and said another 25 people were wounded. An AFP photographer at the medical facility saw the bodies of four children wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds. Several wounded children lay or sat in shock on hospital beds including one with severed legs. A man cried out after learning his son had died as others around him tried to comfort him. Blood-stained satchels Small blue school bags and a tiny pair of shoes lay in a corner drenched in blood. Outside the primary school children stared at the pools of blood staining the concrete ground. ""I was coming out of school and was about to turn into a side street when the shell hit. There were dead people wounded people"" one child told AFP. The observatory said regime bombardment on Tuesday also hit other areas of Eastern Ghouta where opposition fighters have been battling President Bashar Assads troops for six years. The regime on July 22 announced a ceasefire with rebels in the besieged area which has been included in a so-called de-escalation zone agreed by Turkey Russia and Iran. On Tuesday regime shelling on the Mesraba area also in Eastern Ghouta killed three civilians including one child the observatory said. An AFP journalist at a morgue saw rescue volunteers and young men slip the bodies of a father and his son into white plastic bags. May God avenge oppressors the mans brother cried. In the town of Harasta shelling also hit near a school as pupils were leaving it wounding 10 people including five children. On Sunday 11 civilians including a journalist for pro-opposition television were killed in Eastern Ghouta. Malnutrition The shelling comes as Eastern Ghouta where an estimated 400000 people live faces a mounting humanitarian crisis. Shocking recent AFP images from the region showed severely underweight children and doctors reported two infants had died of malnutrition and related complications. On Monday dozens of trucks carrying aid for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta. The region was once a prime agricultural region famed for its orchards. But the rebel stronghold has been under a tight government siege since 2013 causing shortages of food and medicine as well as price hikes for the local and smuggled supplies available. Basic services are virtually non-existent with electricity produced only by generators and water often dirty and a vector for disease. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. The conflict has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers and the Daesh terror group extremists who took over large swathes of the country in 2014. But the extremists have since lost most of the territory they controlled and were ousted two weeks ago from their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa. They face twin offensives in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor from the regime and the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces.",jordantimes,11/2/2017,damascus,1
1924058068,Russian strike kills 38 fleeing civilians in east Syria _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 042017 BEIRUT A Russian air strike killed 38 civilians on Wednesday as they tried to cross the Euphrates River to escape fighting in eastern Syrias Deir Ezzor province a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain said nine children were among those killed as they tried to cross the river aboard rafts escaping from areas where Russian-backed regime forces are battling the Daesh terror group. The monitor which earlier gave a toll of 20 in the strikes said the dead included an Iraqi family. Deir Ezzor borders Iraq and civilians have fled into the province to escape the battles against Daesh in their own country. Two campaigns are being fought against Daesh in east Deir Ezzor with one on the western side of the Euphrates river that slices diagonally across the province led by Syrian troops and backed by ally Russia. The second is being fought by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters on the eastern bank of the river. The observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The group has reported hundreds of civilians killed in operations against Daesh in Deir Ezzor and neighbouring Raqqa province where the SDF is fighting with US support to capture the former extremist bastion Raqqa city. On Tuesday the observatory said a US-led coalition strike in Raqqa killed at least 18 civilians. The coalition says it takes all measures possible to avoid civilian casualties and that it investigates each credible allegation. Last month it acknowledged the deaths of over 700 civilians in its strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014. Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes since its intervened in Syrias war in 2015 and dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. The deaths in Deir Ezzor on Wednesday prompted outrage from the opposition Syrian National Coalition which described the incident as a heinous crime.

1924058069,US-led strike kills 18 civilians in Syria_s Raqqa _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 032017 BEIRUT A US-led coalition air strike killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in the Daesh extremist groups former stronghold of Raqqa the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. International coalition planes targeted water wells where a group of civilians were gathered in the north of Raqqa city killing at least 18 civilians observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based group said four children were among the dead. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into Raqqa in June and has since wrested 90 per cent of the city from Daesh. But activists say coalition strikes in support of the operation have killed hundreds of civilians and caused enormous damage. The coalitions spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon said it does everything within its power to limit harm to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure. He said rigorous standards were applied to coalition targeting and extraordinary efforts taken to avoid civilian deaths. The coalition conducts a detailed assessment of each and every allegation of possible civilian casualties and we will do so for this allegation as well he added in an e-mail to AFP. In late September the coalition acknowledged the deaths of 735 civilians in its strikes on Syria and Iraq since 2014. But activists say the toll is much higher. Raqqa has faced water shortages for months because of damage to pipelines caused by suspected coalition strikes. Even in the early days of the Raqqa assault residents said they feared being caught in air strikes or shelling when they ventured to wells or the Euphrates River that runs south of the city to draw water.,jordantimes,10/5/2017,raqqa,0
1924058070,Russia says it kills 180 extremists mercenaries in Syria claims Shishani_s death | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 082017 MOSCOW Some 120 Daesh terror group extremists and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Russian air strikes in Syria over the past 24 hours the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday. Puzzlingly the ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders including Omar Al Shishani had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier Russian strike. Moscow reported Shishanis death despite the fact that the Pentagon said in 2016 the notorious fighter had been killed by American troops in Iraq. A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 [Daesh] fighters including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen the ministry said adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal. Mayadeen is one of Daeshs last bastions in Syria. In another air strike more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union Tunisia and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor. The ministry said large numbers of foreign mercenaries were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq. It also said Russian forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar Al Shishani Alaa Al Din Al Shishani and Salah Al Din Al Shishani all natives of the Northern Caucasus. Moscow reported their deaths after taking several days to confirm the results of an earlier strike on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed a Daesh command post with more than 30 fighters including the natives of the Northern Caucasus. Omar the Chechen The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard. Shishani whose nom de guerre means Omar the Chechen came from the former Soviet state of Georgias Pankisi Gorge region which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens. He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006 and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008. He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh. The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for further comment. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights disagreed with Moscows report. Salah Al Din Al Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by extremist groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander and his extremist group is allied with the extremists of Al Nusra Front but only in their fight against the regime he said. He has no links with Daesh The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Russian and coalition air raids. The observatory said Russian air strikes on Thursday night killed 14 people including three children fleeing across the Euphrates on rafts near Mayadeen. Since it intervened in Syria in 2015 Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes and it dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. Moscow has been staging air strikes in support of its ally Damascus targeting both Daesh in Deir Ezzor province and rival extremists led by Al Qaedas former Syria affiliate in Idlib province in the northwest.,jordantimes,10/8/2017,deir ezzor,1

1924058079,US-led air strikes in Syria kill dozens of civilians,"21 Jul 2016 Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed by US-led air strikes as they fled from the front lines of a battle raging in the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of ""clay and adobe"" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing ""a woman with four of her children and an old man"" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

People inspect the damage at a market in Syria hit by air strikes on June 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air stikes thought to be carried out by Syrian and Russian forces killed at least 17 people including 8 children in a market in the Syrian city of Ashara near the southeast provincial capital Deir al-Zor city on Monday. According to the British-based human rights organisation it is feared the death toll will rise because of the high number of serious injuries. The Syrian regime which has been supported by Russia in aerial strikes across the country since September 2015 began attacking DAESH last week. But the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its warplanes carried out air strikes on the market place. Many civilians who are unable to move in and out of DAESH-held areas face the risk of being killed by constant air strikes. People salvage goods from an aid convoy that was damaged during an air strike in the opposition held area of al-Sakhour district of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) UN says such offensives are successful in making gains on DAESH. They also put millions of people at risk of displacement. The UNS Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week that 20000 people have already been displaced as a result of the Kurdish-led offensive in Eastern Aleppos Abu Qalqal and Menbij city sub-districts which are mostly under the control of DAESH. According to Syrian government sources the army captured crossroads to advance to Raqqa in eastern Aleppo and the strategic city Deir al Zour which connects the territory to Iraq. The recent attack which killed civilians in the DAESH controlled territory came shortly after another strike by regime forces. At least 15 civilians were killed in air strikes on Friday in the DAESH-held area of Boulil near Deir al Zour. Men walk near a damaged building in Aleppos opposition held al-Fardous district Syria May 26 2016.

The strikes came as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (mainly Arab and Kurdish forces) said they had encircled a stronghold of DAESH militants in Manbij northern Syria cutting off a major supply route. On June 1 Daraya received its first shipment of medical aid. ""The last time people were filling the streets waiting for the aid to come in"" activist Shadi Matar told AFP from inside Daraya.

Russian military jets are seen at Hmeymim air base in Syria June 18 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) The death toll from Russian and Syrian strikes in the opposition-held city of Al Quriyah has risen to 82 people including 58 civilians the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. ""Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir Ezzor city killed 58 civilians"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rights group added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH fighters. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the jihadist-held Raqqa province. Government forces were also fighting rebels in northern neighbourhoods of the city in a bid to halt rocket fire on government-held districts. Elsewhere in Syria in Manbij US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) overran a key road junction in the citys south after capturing nearby grain silos overnight. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including Al-Qaeda non-jihadist rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and DAESH. Members of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attend the funeral of eight fellow fighters who died during an assault against the Islamic State (IS) group in the town of Manbij on June 24 2016. (AFP) The Raqa Revolutionaries Brigades - one of the Arab components of the Kurdish-dominated alliance - also said the SDF had seized the silos and pushed into the city. In 2014 DAESH took control of Manbij it was a key transit point for foreign fighters and funds as well as a trafficking hub for oil antiquities and other plundered goods. The SDF launched its offensive to take Manbij on May 31 driving across the Euphrates River from the east with military advice from some 200 US special forces troops. According to the Observatory DAESH has lost 463 fighters in the battle and the SDF has lost at least 89.

The blasts hit regime-held Tartous and Homs as well as Hasakeh which is mostly controlled by the PKKs Syrian affiliate YPG. Regime media said at least 30 people had been killed and 45 injured in a double bomb attack just outside the city of Tartous in the coastal province of the same name which is a stronghold of Bashar al-Assads regime. A car bomb exploded on the Arzuna bridge followed by a suicide bomber who detonated his explosive belt when people gathered to help the wounded Syrian regime television said.

Hasakeh city has been regularly targeted by DAESH including in July when a bomber on a motorcycle killed at least 16 people outside a bakery in the city. The terrorist group has been losing ground to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces which is mainly comprised of the YPG even though its affiliate organisation the PKK is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and the EU. More recently DAESH has also lost territory to Turkish-backed Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters.

Hamza al-Khatib the director of a hospital in the rebel-held east told Reuters the death toll from the strikes was 45. The strikes come after Russia and the Syrian regime rejected a US plea to halt flights burying any hope for the revival of the ceasefire. Opposition officials and rescue workers said incendiary bombs were among the weapons used on the city. ""Its as if the planes are trying to compensate for all the days they didnt drop bombs during the ceasefire"" Ammar al-Selmo the head of the Civil Defense rescue service in opposition-held eastern Aleppo told Reuters.

The assault by aircraft from the Syrian regime its Russian allies or both made it clear that Moscow and Damascus had rejected a plea by US Secretary of State John Kerry to halt flights so that aid could be delivered and a ceasefire salvaged. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian regime or mention on regime-run media of Thursdays bombardment. ""It was the heaviest air strikes for months inside Aleppo city"" said Rami Abdulrahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the conflict from Britain. Homs evacuation Assad has appeared as uncompromising as ever in recent weeks reiterating his goal of taking back the whole country on the day the US-Russian brokered truce took effect. The regimes main focus has been to consolidate its grip over the main cities of western Syria and the coastal region that is the ancestral homeland of Assads Alawite sect. On Thursday around 120 opposition fighters and their families were evacuated from the last opposition-held district of Homs under an agreement with the regime by which they were given safe passage to nearby opposition-held areas. Families carry their luggage into a bus to evacuate the besieged district of Waer in the central Syrian city of Homs after a local agreement reached between opposition forces and Syrian regime military forces September 22 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) The opposition says such agreements are part of a regime strategy to forcibly displace populations from opposition-held areas after years of siege and bombardment.

1924058098,Russian and Syrian regime strikes kill over 80 in Aleppo,"13 Oct 2016 In fresh strikes Russian and Syrian regime jets pounded opposition-held parts of Aleppo early on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Severe bombardment on Syrias biggest city has killed at least 84 civilians including children the monitor and a civil defence official said. The fresh aerial assault was accompanied by the regimes advance on the northeastern outskirts of Aleppo where its forces captured several hilltops overlooking the opposition-held areas. Air strikes killed 13 people on Thursday when warplanes hit several rebel-held districts including al-Kalaseh Bustan al-Qasr and al-Sakhour civil defense official Ibrahim Abu al-Laith told Reuters from Aleppo. Seven children were among 71 civilians killed in opposition-held areas on Tuesday and Wednesday SOHR head Rami Abdel Rahman said. Up to 300000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged parts of eastern Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) ""The toll jumped because there were so many people who died of their wounds and others whose bodies were still stuck under the rubble"" he added. The Syrian regime forces launched the offensive to retake the whole of Aleppo on September 22. Eastern Aleppo has been held by the opposition fighters since 2012. Up to 300000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged parts of the city. The regime operation has been backed by Moscow which stepped up its air strikes against opposition-held areas earlier this week. A ceasefire in Syria brokered by the US and Russia collapsed last month. The Russian government and Syrian regime blamed their foes for breaking the ceasefire. Russia last week vetoed a UN Security Council resolution chalked out by France calling for an end to the bombings in Aleppo. Kerry and Lavrov to meet in Switzerland US officials on Wednesday said US Secretary of State John Kerry will meet his Russian counterpart in Switzerland on Saturday to discuss Syria. The meeting will include foreign ministers from Turkey Qatar Saudi Arabia and Iran. Earlier Kerry broke off talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the offensive which included air strikes on hospitals. The US and France termed the assaults ""war crimes"" and said Syria and Russia were responsible. The resumption of talks despite the offensive underlined the lack of options facing Western nations over the Syria conflict.

1924058102,Suicide bombing kills 29 at Syria-Turkey border,"6 Oct 2016 At least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suicide bombing that targeted a Syria-Turkey border crossing on Thursday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the casualties included fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) the Turkish-backed force which has played a pivotal role in the fight against DAESH along the Syria-Turkey border. The attack took place on the Syrian side of the Atmeh crossing west of Aleppo during a change of guard among the FSA the Observatory said. According to Anadolu Agency the blast targeted the Atmeh refugee camp. In an online statement DAESH has claimed responsibilty for the attack. Witnesses said most of the fighters killed in the attack were from the Failaq al-Sham. The group has been fighting alongside other Turkish-backed factions in Ankaras offensive dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"" against DAESH. (TRT World and Agencies) The fighters use the Atmeh crossing to move between the Syrian province of Idlib through Turkey to the areas where anti-DAESH operations are taking place the Observatory said. Residents said they also use it to evacuate wounded fighters. Among the dead from the Atmeh blast were the head of the top civil judicial body in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Sheikh Khaled al-Sayyed and a judge who worked with him a witness and a rebel official said. Idlib province where Atmeh is located is a bastion of the opposition groups fighting Bashar al-Assads regime. The multi-sided civil war has raged on for more than five years. Opposition fighters have been targeted at the crossing before. DAESH claimed responsibility for a mid-August suicide attack there that killed at least 32. The fighters killed on Thursday were also among those participating in Euphrates Shield. Ankara began the unprecedented cross-border operation on August 24 saying it was targeting both DAESH and the YPG which Turkey considers a terrorist group. The operation has so far captured the DAESH stronghold of Jarablus and is pushing towards the towns of Dabiq and Al-Bab.

1924058107,At least seven children die in regime shelling at rebel-held area in Syria,31 Oct 2017 At least seven Syrian children were killed in regime shelling of a rebel-held area outside Damascus on Tuesday most as they left school activists said. The Syrian regime has intensified its campaign against the last rebel holdouts on the outskirts of the capital as Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan aim to consolidate de-escalation zones in different parts of the country. The limited local truces are aimed at freezing the lines of the six-year-old civil war which has claimed an estimated 400000 lives and allowing humanitarian aid to flow into besieged areas. The Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least five children were killed when a shell landed at the gate of a school in Jisreen a town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as children were leaving for the day. The Observatory said the death toll is likely to rise and that another child was killed in the village from another shell. One of the children had his legs blown off. Shelling in the northeastern town of Musraba has meanwhile killed another three people including a child according to the Observatory. The Ghouta Media Center said four were killed including two children. Another shell in Harasta also in the eastern Ghouta suburbs landed near a school but only caused injuries. Eastern Ghouta which is still home to an estimated 350000 people has endured years of siege and shelling which has continued despite a de-escalation agreement backed by the regime and its close allies Russia and Iran. On Monday the United Nations said it reached thousands of residents for the first time in over a month. The area is one of the last remaining pockets of opposition to regime leader Assad and depends on aid and smuggling. Rebels have responded to the shelling with a barrage of mortars lobbed at regime-held districts in Damascus wounding at least 10 civilians in three neighbourhoods. The rebels and the regime are meanwhile set to conclude the latest round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana. The negotiations are sponsored by Turkey which backs the rebels as well as Russia and Iran. The de-escalation zones agreed to in Astana have significantly reduced the violence in many parts of Syria but a lasting political solution remains elusive.

(AFP) (AFP) Russian air strikes killed at least 14 civilians as they were crossing the Euphrates river near the militant-held town of Al Mayadeen in eastern Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Friday. ""They were crossing the river on makeshift rafts in a village south of Mayadeen"" SOHR director Rami Abdel Rahman said adding that three children were among those killed overnight. Russia has in recent days intensified its air raids in support of Syrian regime forces battling militants across the country. Abdel Rahman said the civilians were fleeing the village of Mahkan south of Al Mayadeen which lies about 420 km east of Damascus and is one of the Daeshs main remaining bastions. Al Mayadeen has been under Daesh control since 2014 when the group swept across swathes of Iraq and Syria and proclaimed a ""caliphate"" but regime forces this week advanced to within five km of the town. Poised for Al Mayadeen A military media unit run by the Lebanese Hezbollah group says regime forces and its allies gained control of positions and heights parallel to the main road linking Deir Ezzor and Al Mayadeen located on the Euphrates in eastern Syria. SOHR said the forces were only six km away from the city. Daesh becomes virtual caliphate Experts and officials say Daeshs ""virtual caliphate"" could be hard to conquer. The militant propaganda machine will continue to exist in hidden corners of the dark web inciting sympathisers to action they say. ""Defeating ISIL (Daesh) on the physical battlefield is not enough"" General Joseph Votel the top commander for US military forces in the Middle East warned earlier this year. ""Following even a decisive defeat in Iraq and Syria ISIL (Daesh) will likely retreat to a virtual safe haven a virtual caliphate from which it will continue to coordinate and inspire external attacks as well as build a support base until the group has the capability to reclaim physical territory."" He described this online network as ""a distorted version of the historic Islamic caliphate it is a stratified community of Muslims who are led by a caliph (currently Abu Bakr al Baghdadi) aspire to participate in a state governed by sharia and are located in the global territory of cyberspace."" Under pressure from public authorities internet providers and major online players are beginning to put in place measures and procedures to disrupt Daeshs exploitation of the web.

1924058110,At least 17 dead as suicide bombings hit Damascus,"3 Oct 2017 At least 17 people were killed and many more injured on Monday by suicide bombings that targeted a police station in the Midan neighbourhood of Damascus the capital of Syria. Several suicide bombers believed to have been three detonated themselves in front of and inside the police station according to authorities. Local police officers learned that one of the bombers used a hand grenade to attack the police station from a viaduct before he detonated his explosive device at about 1330 on the viaduct which runs parallel to the police station. ""Previously the attacker whose identity was unknown attacked us. The terrorists outside the police station launched the attack from the viaduct. Police officers and the army unit together resisted and foiled the attack"" said Tarek a police officer. Afterward another bomber detonated his explosive device at the gate of the police station while a third bomber entered the police station and detonated his explosive device after being surrounded by police officers and an army unit. The Syrian regimes Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building. Daesh said three of its fighters carried out an attack on a Damascus police station on Monday. In a statement distributed on a Daesh channel via the Telegram messaging service on Tuesday the group said two of the fighters fired shots in the station before blowing themselves up. The third blew himself up later as ""reinforcements"" arrived. Local state television showed images of damage from inside the building with a black police uniform shirt covered in dust lying in the rubble of partially collapsed walls. Policemen carried one body away from the scene wrapped inside a white tarpaulin. The same police station in Midan was targeted last December when a seven-year-old female suicide bomber blew herself up inside the station. Local reactions According to a witness because the explosion occurred during working hours and the proximity of the police station to the old city of Damascus many people were killed and nearby cars houses and buildings were all destroyed. ""This is a crime. Its a terrorist act. Nobody will accept such an act. It is tragic to see the corpses on the ground. We just began having better conditions and good supplies but what about those people who lost their cars and houses?"" said a local resident. Manal a 28-year-old teacher living in Midan said she heard at least two blasts on Monday afternoon. I was coming back from work when I heard the sound of an explosion it was around 230 pm I didnt know what it was and then there was another explosion a few minutes later and buildings shook she said. Afterwards I heard gunfire which usually happens to get people to move out of the way and clear the road so ambulances can get through to retrieve the injured she added. Damascus attacks Damascus has also been rocked by occasional bomb blasts throughout the Syrian conflict including previous attacks on Midan a middle-class residential and shopping district. In December 2016 three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the neighbourhoods police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated.

The identity of the drone was not confirmed but the sources did not rule out the possibility that it was Russian ""friendly fire"". (AFP) A drone strike on Monday killed at least eight members of the Hezbollah militia in Syria where the Lebanese group is fighting alongside the Syrian regime a Britain-based monitor said. An unidentified ""drone hit a Hezbollah position near the town of Sukhna (in central Homs province) killing eight fighters and injuring more than 20"" said Rami Abdel Rahman the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. Asked about a report that a US drone carried out the strike the spokesman for the US-led coalition said the location was outside its area of operations. Hezbollah is a key force multiplier for Syrian regime leader Bashar al Assad and has fought alongside his forces across the country against rebel forces. Assads forces and allied fighters are currently waging a campaign in Syrias vast Badiya desert region against Daesh. The campaign backed by Assad ally Russia has captured large swathes of territory from the terror group but they have launched deadly counterattacks on regime positions. On Sunday Daesh fighters recaptured the town of Al Qaryatain in Homs province which regime forces took from the group in April 2016. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-regime protests but some non-governmental organisations put the death toll a lot higher.

DAESH said that it killed at least 50 opposition fighters in a suicide bombing on a bus near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. The opposition faces the DAESH threat while fighting intensively against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo DAESH said on Monday they were responsible for a suicide bombing on a bus on Sunday which killed fighters from western-backed Syrian opposition groups near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. In a statement on one of its Telegram channels the hard-line militant group said it killed 50 fighters travelling on the bus from the Failaq al-sham and the al-Zinki groups. It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a suicide bomber struck a bus transporting fighters through the Atmeh border post one of several crossings Syrian opposition uses to bring in fighters and supplies. The monitoring group which relies on activists inside Syria said the attack killed 50 fighters. An activist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said some 200 fighters from various factions are based near Atmeh and bring in weapons through the crossing. The Observatory had earlier reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. The toll includes 126 people killed by opposition shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces on Monday repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city of Aleppo forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized a daily earlier the Syrian government and activists said. The development followed intense battles between the two sides. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. On Sunday evening opposition fighters opened a new front sending a truck bomb into Aleppos western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Syrian opposition groups had used temporary ceasefires in and around Aleppo to regroup and rearm. Lavrov speaking at a news conference in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he realized that brief daily ceasefires in place now to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave were not sufficient. But he said it was difficult to make the ceasefires longer for the moment because of the risk of militants using them to regroup and rearm something he said they had done in the past. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the hardships faced by people in Aleppo could not be alleviated by announcing three-hour ceasefires. ""Its supposed to sound like a concession but its actually cynicism because everybody knows that this amount of time is nowhere near sufficient to actually build up supplies for the desperate people there"" he told a government news conference. He said the killing in Aleppo had to stop and the city needed to receive food and medical items without hindrance. Seibert said Syrias Bashar Assad and Russia an ally of Assad against opposition in Syrias five-year-old civil war were largely responsible for the situation in the city ""Its primarily their decision whether there will be further deaths or whether the people there get help and hope after months of suffering.""",dailysabah,8/7/2016,aleppo,1

All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are ""monitoring"" it. Idlib was the target of the regime because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Idlib but that has been proven wrong as the regime jet fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Idlib province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of ""suffocation"" by barrel bombs. The Assad regime is back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity? The Assad regime has done this before and after the international uproar it had ""given up"" its chemical weapons to international observers. We were told Assad did not have chemical weapons. So now that Assad is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the Assad regime simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist Assad who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have to see that collaborating with terrorists only brings misery and destruction. This time Assad has to be stopped. The chemical weapons Assad uses have to be taken away from him for good and he has to pay for his atrocities. Even the Russians cannot stand behind Assad as he commits these gross violations. The Americans cant simply say they are just interested in fighting Daesh and just turn a blind eye to the dangerous turn of events in Idlib. Tomorrow someone in Syria may decide to use such weapons against the U.S. forces there.Turkey is trying to create its own secure zone that Assad would never dare attack in northern Syria. But the fact that Assad is using his jet fighters and helicopters to attack even the civilians who sympathize with the Syrian opposition shows the urgent need for declaring the safe zones created by Turkey as no-fly zones. This is something that has to be looked into by the international community. The Russians can secure this zone with their air power and their ground to air S-400 missile systems thus at least offering some hope for the Syrian people trying to escape Assads atrocities.",dailysabah,4/13/2017,idlib,1

Thirty ambulances were dispatched from Turkey to rescue those in dire need of help. The Assad regime continues to commit crimes against humanity as more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 others mostly children have been affected by the chlorine gas attack carried out by regime warplanes in the Khan Shaykun town in Idlib. The latest chemical attack was seen as the worst in the countys six-year war. With many civilians suffering respiratory problems in dire need of help Turkey dispatched 30 fully equipped ambulances for rescue operations. The reports claim that it was the third chemical attack in over a week in Syria as the Assad regime consistently targets residential areas. The first two attacks were reported in Hama province an area close to yesterdays chemical attack. After the gas attack the Syrian regime reportedly bombarded a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims. Turkey condemned the chemical attack on Syrias opposition-held town of Idlib describing it as ""a crime against humanity."" The chemical attacks on Idlib were ""inhuman"" and ""unacceptable"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said while stressing the importance of maintaining the fragile Syrian cease-fire. In a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin the president reiterated the need for further efforts to strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Foreign Minister Mevlt avuolu also stated that the suspected use of chemical weapons could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. The parallel series of talks in Astana Kazakhstan aim to bolster the truce to support the U.N. negotiations. Damascus has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days with the moderate Syrian opposition making large incursions into the east of the Syrian capital while the Assad regime has responded with airstrikes on opposition positions. The last round of Astana talks began on Feb. 23 and ended on March 4 without any clear result. The next meetings in Astana are to be held on May 3-4. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was ""seriously concerned"" by reports of a suspected gas attack. ""The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is seriously concerned about the alleged chemical weapons attack reported by the media this morning in the Khan Sheikhun area of southern Idlib"" the group said adding it was ""gathering and analyzing information from all available sources."" Chlorine gas is one of several elements and compounds used in devastating chemical attacks outlawed by international treaties. A high level of exposure to the gas can cause suffocation as the chemical injures the pulmonary airways resulting in severe fluid buildup in the lungs with children and seniors particularly vulnerable. In the wake of the 2013 attack Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. His government declared a 1300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons amid international outrage at a nerve gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus. Those weapons have been destroyed but member states of the OPCW have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything in 2013. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then. The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead. Frances foreign minister called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a ""disgusting"" gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. ""In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council"" he added. France Britain and the United States in February put forward a resolution to impose sanctions targeting Syrian government officials over accusations of chemical weapon attacks during the six-year conflict.

Jets ""believed to belong to the international coalition"" struck the town of al-Bukamal in the south of the province near the Iraqi border killing three militants and 13 civilians including children the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The monitoring group said airstrikes also killed seven civilians in the town of al-Husainiyah further north along the Euphrates river. There was no immediate comment from the coalition which has said it tries to avoid civilian deaths in its bombing campaigns against Daesh militants in Syria and neighboring Iraq. Earlier this month the coalition said its raids there and in Iraq and unintentionally killed at least 220 civilians. But other monitors say the number is much higher.

Another airstrike this one during the day hit a opposition-held village in the northwest on Tuesday killing a woman and nine children. The activists said the late Monday strike on the town of Boukamal on the Iraqi border was similar to airstrikes carried out by the U.S.-led coalition that has been targeting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition have killed dozens of civilians over the past several weeks as the battle against the extremists intensifies. The new purported took place as the U.S.-led coalition came under fire from Human Rights Watch over another deadly incident in northern Syria last month in which dozens of people were killed. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency said the strike of Boukamal killed six people and wounded 15 all of them women and children. It did not say whether any Daesh fighters were also killed. The U.S. militarys regional command CENTCOM said in response to a query by The Associated Press that it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Activists gave different casualty tolls. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Boukamal strike killed 15 civilians including women and children as well as three Iraqi Daesh fighters. Opposition activist Omar Abu Laila who currently lives in Europe but is from the province where the strike took place and maintains contacts there said 10 people were killed including an Iraqi family of four. He said Daesh cordoned off the area and cut all telecommunications after the strike which heavily damaged at least four buildings. ""The number of casualties is huge"" Abu Laila said adding that mosque loudspeakers were used to urge people to head to hospitals to donate blood. Daesh used to control wide parts of Syria and Iraq where the group declared a caliphate in 2014. Over the past year the extremists have suffered a string of defeats at the hands of an array of Syrian and Iraqi forces. On Tuesday in northern Syria an airstrike on the village of Maaret Harmeh killed 10 people and wounded several others activists said. The Observatory said those killed were all relatives. The Civil Defense another activist group said 10 people were also wounded in that attack. Maaret Harmeh is close to the town of Khan Sheikhoun where a chemical weapons attack killed nearly 90 people on April 4. The United States has accused the Assad regime of being behind the attack and fired missiles at a Syrian army base. Syria denies the charges. Meanwhile Human Rights Watch said in a report Tuesday that U.S. forces appear to have failed to take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties in a March 16 airstrike that killed dozens of people in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo. U.S. officials said at the time that the airstrike hit an al-Qaida gathering killing dozens of militants. Syrian opposition activists said around 40 people mostly civilians were killed in the crowded Omar Ibn al-Khattab Mosque in the Jeeneh district. U.S. officials at the time also said they found no basis for reports that civilians were killed. However Human Rights Watchs 16-page report said it found no evidence to support the allegation that members of al-Qaida or any other armed group were meeting in the mosque. It said a religious lecture was being held at the time of the attack and that prayers were about to begin. ""The U.S. seems to have gotten several things fundamentally wrong in this attack and dozens of civilians paid the price"" said Ole Solvang HRW deputy emergencies director. ""The U.S. authorities need to figure out what went wrong start doing their homework before they launch attacks and make sure it doesnt happen again.""

1924058147,At least 126 dead in blast targeting evacuation convoy stranded near Aleppo,"Published April 15 2017 At least 126 people including 68 children were killed Saturday in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged regime-held towns a monitoring group said Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. The dead included 109 evacuees 13 of whom were women from the villages of Foua and Kefraya in the north-western province of Idlib the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The other fatalities were escorts and fighters who were on the site of the bombing outside the northern city of Aleppo according to the Britain-based watchdog. The toll is expected to rise because there are still critically injured and missing people after the blast the Observatory said. The blast hit the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts where dozens of buses carrying mostly Shiiite residents of two villages al-Foua and Kefraya that are being evacuated in a deal between warring sides were waiting to enter the city. The state TV channel said the explosion was caused by a car bomb. State TV showed horrific images of bodies strewn on the ground and near buses. A senior opposition official said 20 fighters who guarded the buses were killed as well as dozens of passengers. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A military media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah said a suicide attacker had detonated a car bomb near the convoy. Pictures posted on state media showed what appeared to be the aftermath of the explosion with bodies lying on the ground and fires belching out thick black plumes of smoke. Buses were blackened by the blast with their windows blown out. Thousands of Syrians were stuck in and around Aleppo on Saturday as a deal to evacuate people from two Shiite villages in return for Sunni opposition fighters and their families leaving two besieged towns near Damascus halted a war monitor and activists said. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the delay was because opposition groups from Zabadani one of the towns included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. The agreement is one of several concluded in recent months that has seen Bashar al-Assads regime take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. In the latest deal hundreds of rebels and their families evacuated the town of Madaya near Damascus and were taken to the regime-held city of Aleppo. From there they will travel to Idlib province an opposition stronghold. In return pro-regime fighters and residents from the Shiite villages of al-Foua and Kefraya both surrounded by Idlib opposition fighters have left the area and reached Aleppos outskirts. On Saturday those from Madaya sat outside rows of coaches in a bus garage in government-held Aleppo waiting to move onto Idlib pictures sent by a pro-opposition activist showed. Meanwhile residents from the Shiite villages were still waiting in insurgent territory on Aleppos outskirts to cross into the city the Observatory and a witness said. The pro-opposition activist said opposition fighters were saying that a smaller number of pro-regime fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage in Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday night and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the western city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad holds the military advantage over the opposition in the west of the country thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents continue to fight back and have made gains in some areas.",dailysabah,4/5/2017,aleppo,0
1924058148,US-led coalition airstrike kills 18 partner forces Pentagon says,"Published April 13 2017 An air strike on Tuesday by a U.S.-led coalition fighting Daesh mistakenly killed 18 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces south of the city of Tabqa Syria the Pentagon said on Thursday. ""The strike was requested by the partnered forces who had identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position"" it said in a statement referring to the Daesh terror group by an acronym. ""The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position."" Meanwhilee the U.S.-led coalition previously denied an Assad army report it had carried out an air strike that had hit poison gas supplies belonging to Daesh and caused the deaths of hundreds of people. ""The Coalition conducted no strikes in that area at that time. The Syrian claim is incorrect and likely intentional misinformation"" U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian a colaition spokesman told Reuters by email. The army of the Assad regime said Thursday that an air strike late on Wednesday by the U.S.-led coalition hit poison gas supplies belonging to the Daesh terror group releasing a toxic substance that killed ""hundreds including many civilians."" The incident in the eastern Deir al-Zor province proved that Daesh and al Qaeda-linked terrorists ""possess chemical weapons"" a statement by the army flashed on Thursday by Syrian state TV said. The United States launched cruise missiles at a Syrian air base last week in response to a deadly poison gas attack in the west of the country that Washington blamed on Bashar al-Assads regime. Syria and its ally Russia deny Damascus carried out any such chemical attack. Moscow has said the poison gas in that incident last week in Idlib province belonged to rebels. The U.S. strike on the Syrian air base was the first time Washington has deliberately and directly targeted the Syrian government.

A civil defense official told Anadolu Agency that a refugee camp located east of Idlibs Maarat al-Numaan district was targeted by regime war planes. Civil defense units were immediately sent to the attack site to transfer the wounded to nearby hospitals and health centers for medical treatment. The camp reportedly hosted many refugees from Hama and Aleppo while health officials also stated that the death toll could rise due to the high number of injured civilians. Another civil defense official from Idlib told Anadolu Agency that the regime warplanes dropped a total of three parachute bombs on the camp site. Syria has been locked in a devastating civil war since early 2011 initiated by the Assad regime which cracked down on pro-democracy protests that began as part of the Arab Spring uprisings with unexpected brutality and disproportionate force.

1924058151,Assad regime targets civilians in Homs airstrikes,Published April 24 2017 Assad regime forces have carried out a total of 18 airstrikes in the Houla region of central Syrias besieged Homs province leading to the death of five civilians including two women and injuring 15 other civilians. According to Anadolu Agency the airstrikes have been conducted in the towns of Teldo Tel Dahab and Kafr Laha since Sunday night. Civil defense units continue search and rescue efforts in the Houla region. The Assad regime first carried out a massacre in Houla on May 25 2012 during which 108 people were killed including 34 women and 49 children. Since then the region has been under regime siege.

1924058152,At least 8 White Helmets rescuers killed in airstrike in Syrias Hama,"Published April 29 2017 Airstrikes struck a center of Syrias rescuers known as the White Helmets in an opposition-held area in the countrys center killing eight volunteers opposition activists said Saturday. The airstrike was one of the deadliest against the rescuers who operate in opposition-held areas and who have garnered world attention for operating in extreme conditions pulling survivors out of recently struck areas. The volunteers have often been targeted by Assad regime airstrikes in what are known as double tap attacks as they work to rescue others. The local White Helmets in the central Hama province said an air raid on one of their centers in Kfar Zeita killed eight members of the team. The group said five bodies were lifted from the rubble and the rescuers continued to look for the others. The Britain-based opposition monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the number of those killed is likely to rise as the search regime and Russia aircraft have targeted opposition-held areas. The central Hama province have been scene to intense violence in recent weeks as the regime attempts to push back an opposition offensive. Separately Saturday regime army said its troops and allied fighters repelled an attack by Daesh terrorist group on a strategic area held by the regime in southern Aleppo province. The attack took place in Khanaser southeast Aleppo a strategic region that links Aleppo with central and western Syria. The area has changed hands many times during the conflict. But last year regime forces and allied fighters wrested control of Khanaser from Daesh. The military media arm said Daesh attacked Um Mayyal village near a mountain range in Khanaser and other areas. The Observatory said Daesh fighters launched the attack on military posts in the area triggering intense clashes and leaving many casualties. Daesh-affiliated Aamaq news agency claimed Daesh fighters killed 30 regime soldiers in the attack. Near the capital hundreds of Syrians from the oppositon-held suburbs of eastern Ghouta near Damascus protested against infighting between the insurgent groups that began Friday and left dozens killed in the area. The infighting came amid an intensified regime offensive in the area near Damascus which the opposition fighters have controlled for years but has been increasingly squeezed by regime advances. ""God rid us of all leaders"" the protesters chanted criticizing the head of the insurgent groups for diverting their weapons from the front line with the regime. The infighting is pitting the powerful Army of Islam group against al-Rahman Corps and al-Qaida-linked group the Levant Liberation Committee or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Each side blames the other for triggering the fighting in the power struggle over control of eastern Ghouta. Some activists have called on Army of Islam to rid eastern Ghouta of the powerful al-Qaida-linked group. The Observatory said shots were fired at the protesters in one area leaving five injured. In 24 hours of fighting the Observatory said at least 38 opposition fighters from the warring sides were killed. Damascus-based Shaam News Network put the number at 60 in addition to six civilians killed because of the clashes. For the past three years the regime has been unable to regain control of the eastern suburbs of Damascus. But in recent weeks an intensified offensive points to a new determination to retake the area.

1924058153,Airstrikes by Assad regime warplanes kill 4 in Syrias Idlib destroy mosque in Hama,"Published April 29 2017 At least four people were killed and 11 others were injured in airstrikes reportedly carried out by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. ""The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies"" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622. During his life he was a military commander in the Muslim-Quraysh Wars and during the Rashidun conquest of the Levant. He died of the plague in 639 and his tomb can be found in modern day Jordan.",dailysabah,4/16/2017,idlib,1
1924058155,Assad regime kills at least 75 in refugee camp,"Published October 31 2014 Activists in Syria reported that at least 75 people died from barrel bomb attacks carried out by the Syrian air force loyal to the Bashar Assad regime. The activists said some corpses were even beyond recognition. The bombs were dropped on a camp near al-Habeet in the northern province of Idlib on Wednesday killing mostly women and children at the camp. Footage posted on YouTube showed corpses of women and children and burning tents while people scrambled to save the wounded. ""Its a massacre of refugees"" a voice off camera said. ""Let the whole world see this they are displaced people. Look at them. They are civilians displaced civilians"" he said. The U.S. said it was ""horrified"" by the reports of the bombing adding that it could not confirm details. ""The attack on the Abedin camp was nothing short of barbaric"" said state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""Unfortunately if it is confirmed to be the work of the [Assad] regime it is only the latest act of brutality by the regime against its own people."" Camp residents told Reuters that the attack took place on Wednesday with two barrel bombs dropped from an army helicopter. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that the Assad regime carried out the air attack on the camp. U.S. officials acknowledged Wednesday that the solution to the crisis in Syria would ultimately require Assads removal even though coalition operations do not target his regime. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the solution in Syria will ""ultimately have to result in Assads departure."" She added ""You have an illegitimate and exceedingly violent leadership that has created conditions not only that have been so harmful to the population but have made it a very attractive magnet for terrorists"" while speaking at the Harman Center for the Arts based in Washington. Rices deputy Tony Blinken speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said that the train and equip program that the coalition will sponsor for moderate Syrian opposition fighters will also fight the Assad regime. Responding to a question as to why airstrikes do not target Assad forces that drop barrel bombs on civilians Blinken said the strategic plan of the coalition is to ultimately destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Blinken said the challenge for keeping the coalition is to deal with the different agendas that each country has. Blinken added in the end that the ""glue holding them together"" is ISISs violence. The war in Syria which started in March 2011 with pro-democracy protests but rapidly grew into a horrific civil war has caused the death of more than 200000 people and at least 60000 are missing.

1924058166,23 terrorists killed in N. Syria after Turkish artillery coalition jets pound Daesh targets - Daily Sabah,Published June 20 2016 At least 23 DAESH members were killed Sunday in northern Syria in a Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and U.S.-led coalition operation security sources said. Turkish artillery and coalition jets hit 33 weapons emplacements including Katyusha rockets which were reportedly preparing to attack Turkey security sources said on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media. During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border.

1924058169,Regime Russia air strikes kill 39 in Idlib as strikes continue to pound Road of death to Aleppo,"Published June 12 2016 At least 39 people were killed and dozens were injured in airstrikes launched by the Syrian regime and Russian warplanes in Syrias western province of Idlib on Sunday. A Syrian regime warplane struck a marketplace in the opposition-held province local civil defense official Leys al-Faris told Anadolu Agency. ""At least 36 people were killed and 50 others injured in the attack"" he said. Al-Faris described the attack as a ""massacre"" committed by the Bashar Assad regime during the fasting month of Ramadan which began in Syria last week. He said rescuers were struggling to extract people from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Meanwhile three people were killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the city of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib. ""Rescuers are looking for survivors following the attack"" al-Faris said. Since April 21 Syrian regime forces and Russian warplanes have intensified attacks on opposition-held areas in Syria killings scores of civilians. This comes as the opposition-held sector of Syrias divided city of Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world in recent days by an escalation of air and artillery strikes on the only road in putting hundreds of thousands of people under effective siege. A regime campaign to fully capture Aleppo would most likely bury what little hope remains of reviving a diplomatic effort to end the five-year-old civil war after talks and a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia fell apart earlier this year. Aleppo Syrias largest city before the war when it had more than 2 million people has been divided for years into opposition and government sectors and capturing all of it has been one of Bashar Assads biggest goals. An estimated 350000 people are still thought to live in the opposition sector in harsh conditions made worse by the latest attempt to besiege them by cutting off the last remaining route out the Castello Road named for Aleppos old castle. ""The regime was not able to cut the road by land so it has decided to keep the planes in the sky continuously hitting everything that passes regardless of what it is"" said Zakaria Malahifji senior official in the Aleppo opposition group Fastaqim. ""Whoever wants to go on the Castello road is undertaking a suicide mission"" he said. ""Its been this way for 10 or 12 days. The situation was difficult before - it was targeted and people were crossing with difficulty - but now it is almost cut nobody dares to use it"" he said speaking at his groups office in the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the Syrian border. The international focus in Syria in recent weeks has partly turned towards the conflict with Islamic State fighters as both the government and its enemies have made gains at the expense of the ultra-hardline Islamist militants on several fronts. But the separate hope of foreign powers - that the wider civil war could also be resolved - has broken down with Aleppo potentially the biggest battlefield of all. Hundreds of people have been killed there since peace talks broke off. Assad vowed in a speech last week to recapture ""every inch"" of Syria. Aleppo he said would be a ""graveyard"" for the ambitions of his regional foe Turkish President Tayyip Erdoan who has backed opposition groups. A pro-Damascus source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the reference was a signal of his intentions ""Why this threat? Because there are preparations for something big in Aleppo."" So far pro-regime ground forces aided by Iranian and Lebanese Shiite militias have been unable to complete the encirclement of Aleppo by capturing a narrow corridor of territory through which the Castello Road passes. The highway had long been under sniper fire but attacks from the air and artillery sharply increased less than two weeks ago with more planes flying and new rockets and guns moved into range. ""Castello is the road to death to Aleppo. I did not know whether I would make it to Aleppo city alive"" said Mohamad Adeeb an opposition activist who drove the road on Friday. ""I saw death with my own eyes with corpses lying on the way and dozens of trucks and civilian cars and bodies that none of the civil defence teams were able to recover because of the intensity of the shelling of the regime and Russian warplanes."" Inside Aleppo the new pressure on the road has driven up prices of goods adding to the suffering of those still there. The Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights says more than 300 people have been killed in air strikes and government bombardment of opposition-held Aleppo since April. Opposition sources say the toll is much higher with dozens of people currently being killed each day in eastern Aleppo one of the bloodiest spells it has suffered in the conflict. Civil defence emergency workers operating in opposition-held areas say more than 450 people were killed there in the last month. ""It is a difficult and dangerous period we are going through. Aleppo is almost under siege"" Abu Yassine said. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000 people.",dailysabah,6/15/2016,idlib,1
1924058170,Daesh claims responsibility for bombings near Damascus at least 20 dead,Published June 11 2016 Suicide bombers struck outside a Shiite shrine near Syrias capital Saturday leaving at least 20 people dead a monitor said in an attack claimed by the Daesh group. The official SANA news agency said two suicide bombers one in a car attacked the entrance to the Sayyida Zeinab shrine which is revered by Shiites around the world. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a British-based monitoring group said at least 20 people were killed including 13 civilians and more than 30 wounded in the blasts. SANA gave a toll of at least 12 dead and 55 wounded. Daesh claimed the attack via its Amaq news agency saying it was carried out by three suicide bombers. The shrine around 10 kilometres (six miles) south of the centre of Damascus is heavily guarded by pro-government forces but has still been the target of several attacks including those claimed by the Daesh terrorist group. Syrias official Al-Ikhbariya channel showed images from the scene of burned-out cars billowing with plumes of black smoke. Firefighters battled to extinguish the flames as shop signs lay in the street. The last attack on Sayyida Zeinab on April 25 killed at least seven and wounded dozens. A string of Daesh bombings near the shrine in February left 134 people dead most of them civilians according to the Observatory. And in January another attack claimed by Daes killed 70 people. Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah cited the threat to Sayyida Zeinab as a principal reason for its intervention in Syrias civil war on the side of Bashar al-Assad.

The Daesh group claimed responsibility for the attack. Media reports said a truck loaded with large quantities of explosives blew up on the western edge of the town of Qamishli followed by an explosives-packed motorcycle a few minutes later in the same area. The blasts caused massive damage in the area and rescue teams were working to recover victims from under the rubble the SANA news agency said. This photo captured from the town of Nusaybin near the Turkish side of the border shows plume of smoke occurred after the explosion. (IHA Photo) Qamishli near the Turkish border is mainly controlled by PYD but Syrian regime forces are present and control the towns airport. Syrian television broadcast footage showing people running away from a mushroom of gray smoke rising over the town and others running amid wrecked or burnt cars.

Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave.

Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.,dailysabah,7/6/2016,aleppo,0

1924058178,25 children killed in airstrikes in eastern Syria in latest round of Russian Syrian bombing UNICEF,"Published June 27 2016 A day after it was announced that Russian and Syrian regime airstrikes killed 58 civilians in eastern Syria UNICEF said 25 casualties were children Twenty-five children were reportedly killed in airstrikes that hit heavily crowded areas in a town in eastern Syria UNICEF has said. Quoting reports from its local partners in Syria UNICEF said health workers were reported to have pulled bodies of children from under rubble in the town of al-Quria in Deir ez-Zor province which is mostly under DAESH control. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported on Saturday that air strikes carried out by Syrian or Russian warplanes killed dozens of people in al-Quria. Deir ez-Zor province links DAESHs de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa with territory it controls in Iraq. ""Three attacks reportedly hit heavily crowded areas including a mosque during prayer time"" UNICEF said in a statement. ""UNICEF deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to the conflict to keep children out of harms way."" On Sunday a monitor said at least 82 people including 58 civilians were killed during airstrikes launched by Russia and Bashar Assads regime on the DAESH-held area of eastern Syria. ""Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir ez-Zor city killed 58 civilians"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH extremists. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir e-Zzor the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the extremist-held Raqqa province. Last week the Syrian opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) called on U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to launch an investigation into their assertions that Russia has repeatedly used air-delivered incendiary weapons against civilians in Syria. ""Russian air forces have repeatedly deployed incendiary weapons and cluster munitions to kill main and terrorize Syrian civilians including in at least 10 documented incidents"" Riad Hijab coordinator of the opposition HNC wrote to Ban. ""They have violated the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and breached international humanitarian law"" he wrote. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests which erupted as part of the Arab Spring uprisings with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Russia first began its air campaign in Syria on Sept. 30 of last year. While Russia claims its campaign is aimed primarily at the DAESH terrorist group it has repeatedly targeted civilian areas and the moderate anti-regime opposition groups that control them. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced throughout the war-battered country according to the U.N. The Syrian Center for Policy Research a nongovernmental organization however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000. Watchdog Thousands tortured to death by Syrian regime Meanwhile a human rights group said more than 12000 people have been tortured to death by the Syrian regime since 2011. In a Sunday statement the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said that 12679 people died of torture from March 2011 to June 2016. ""The Syrian regime is responsible for 99 percent of deaths due to torture at detention centers"" the statement added which was issued to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. SNHR Director Fadl Abdel-Ghani said his group could not document any case of detention with a legal warrant. ""The regime has committed crimes against humanity"" he said citing sexual assault killing and involuntary disappearance as some of the practices by the Syrian regime. Last month The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that at least 60000 people have died in Syrian government jails during the five-year conflict. He said more than 20000 of them had died at Sednaya prison near Damascus. The observatory said it had been able to verify the deaths of 14456 people 110 of them under the age of 18 since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. ""We know large numbers of people have died in detention in Syria"" said Nadim Houry deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch in a telephone interview. A Syrian defector known as Caesar in 2013 smuggled out tens of thousands of photos taken between May 2011 and August 2013 that show at least 6786 separate individuals who had died in government custody HRW said in a report issued in December. That toll was calculated by the Syrian Association for Missing and Conscience Detainees (SAFMCD) which was formed by an opposition body and reviewed all the photos the HRW report said.

Human Rights Watch says in a report issued Wednesday that it collected the names of 69 civilians killed including 19 children by improvised mines in schools homes and on roads in Manbij during a five-day investigation this month. The victims were killed during and after the fighting for control of the town. Ole Solvang deputy emergencies director at the New York-based group says Daesh ""mined virtually everything including quite literally the kitchen sink before they left."" Forces of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dominated by PKK terrorist organizations Syrian offshoot PYDs armed wing YPG (Peoples Protection Units) took Manbij from Daesh in August after a two-month-long siege over the period of two years after the terrorists moved in. Turkey has voiced reservations in YPG moving into Manbij which has a predominantly Arab population. The country also considers YPG controlling a continuous area south of its border a national security threat and repeatedly asked SDFs main supporter U.S. for YPG to retreat east of the Euphrates River. On Aug. 24 Turkey launched Euphrates Shield operation to clear the towns of Jarablus al Rai and al Bab from Daesh while preventing YPG to extend its control over these towns.

1924058191,Aleppo airstrikes kill 36 people in opposition-held areas,"Published October 17 2016 Airstrikes on opposition-held areas in the northern province of Aleppo Monday killed at least 36 people including children opposition activists said as violence in Syria continued while a major operation began against Daesh in neighboring Iraq. Most of the deaths were in the village of Oweijel just west of the city of Aleppo where at least 23 people were killed in an airstrike that also wounded dozens according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Another monitoring group the Local Coordination Committees said the air raid was carried out by Russian warplanes and put the death toll at 30. More than a dozen people were also killed in a besieged eastern opposition-held neighborhood in Aleppo. The eastern parts of the city Syrias largest have been subjected in recent weeks to the worst aerial attacks in years. The airstrikes have claimed hundreds of lives wounded many others and demolished entire buildings. Opposition activists have blamed Russian and Syrian government warplanes for the strikes. The Observatory said Mondays airstrikes hit in the Marjeh neighborhood. The Aleppo Media Center an activist collective said those killed included 11 people with the same family name of Qabs ranging from a month-and-a-half-old baby girl to a 25-year-old man. Mondays airstrikes coincided with the launch in neighboring Iraq of a major operation by Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh. There have been concerns the government in Damascus could use the timing of the Mosul offensive to press its onslaught in Aleppo while world attention is diverted to developments in Iraq. Also Monday Syrian state media claimed 49 oppostion fighters were killed and wounded in fighting in the neighborhoods of Sheikh Saeed and Shurfa on the southern edges of Aleppo. In the nearby province of Idlib a U.S.-led coalition drone struck a car in the provincial capital that carries the same name killing all inside according to the Observatory official. It was not immediately clear who was in the vehicle but such attacks have previously targeted officials with al-Qaidas affiliate in Syria known as Fatah al-Sham Front. The Observatory said the attack targeted a faction commander. An official with Fatah al-Sham Front formerly known as Nusra Front said all those in the car were ""martyred."" The man who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said it was not clear if members of his group were targeted. Earlier this month a drone attack killed top al-Qaida official Ahmed Salama Mabrouk. The United States and Britain on Sunday acknowledged the Western worlds weak support for any military action against Syrias government as they seek ways to pressure Syrian regime leader Bashar Assad and his chief backer Russia to halt the deadly Aleppo offensive. After a meeting of 11 governments opposing Assads rule U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson each insisted that all options were on the table. But their stark explanations about the danger of resorting to military force appeared to rule out such a move. The government in Damascus meanwhile appears to be trying to improve relations with Egypt the Arab worlds most populous nation following the first public meeting between Egyptian and Syrian security chiefs. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk head of the National Security Bureau and one of Assads top aides visited Cairo Sunday at the head of a delegation to coordinate with Egypt in the fight against ""terrorism"" in the region Syrias state-run news agency SANA said. SANA said the Syrians met with top intelligence officials including deputy chief of Egypts intelligence agency. It said both sides agreed on ""coordinating political standpoints"" and strengthening the ""cooperation in fighting terrorism."" Egypts pro-government Sada al-Balad and other news websites reported on Sunday that six Syrians arrived on a private jet from Damascus. Earlier this month Egypt voted for rival French and Russian draft resolutions on Syria at the U.N.

1924058193,Death toll rises in Aleppo while British FM blames Russia,"Published October 12 2016 Activists say the death toll in rebel-held Aleppo in Syria continues to rise with at least 27 dead on Tuesday as the Assad forces push to weed out rebels. Russia meanwhile faces what Kremlin officials call Russophobia after British FM Johnson called public protests at its London embassy over airstrikes in Aleppo Casualties pile up in Syrias Aleppo controlled by rebels as the forces loyal to the Assad regime push to recapture it with the aid of Russian airstrikes. Russias assistance meanwhile continues to draw the ire of Europe with the latest salvo from British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson who called for ""picketing"" at the Russian embassy in London. At least 15 people were killed in fresh air strikes and artillery fire on rebel-held areas of Syrias Aleppo on Wednesday a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was expected to rise due to the number of wounded that are in serious condition. The Britain-based monitor said among the areas hit in the bombardment was a market in the neighborhood of Fardos. The deaths come a day after Russia stepped up its air raids on east Aleppo in support of an army operation to recapture the rebel-held sector of the city. The Tuesday raids killed at least 27 people among them four children in several districts including Fardos according to the Observatory. Four people were also killed and 14 wounded during rebel fire in government-held west Aleppo on Tuesday. Among those who survived the Tuesday strikes in the district of Fardos was 13-year-old Jameel Mustafa Habbush who was dug out of the rubble in a four-hour operation by the White Helmets rescue workers. An AFP photographer at the scene said rescuers heard Habbush shouting from under the rubble and began digging towards him. As they worked to free him they administered oxygen clamping a mask to his face as he emerged from the debris. His father and younger brother were reportedly killed in the attack and his mother was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011. In late September the army announced an operation to recapture the rebel-held east Aleppo after the collapse of a short-lived truce. Since then more than 300 people have been killed in bombardments of rebel-held areas according to the Observatory. British foreign minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called for anti-war campaigners to protest outside the Russian embassy in London during a parliamentary debate on the bombing of Aleppo in Syria. ""Id certainly like to see demonstrations outside the Russian embassy"" Johnson told MPs in the parliament. Johnson the former mayor of London known for his many public gaffes said the ""wells of outrage are growing exhausted"" and anti-war groups were not expressing sufficient outrage at the conflict in Aleppo. ""Where is the Stop the War Coalition at the moment? Where are they?"" he said. The Stop the War group was co-founded by current opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to protest against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It brought millions of Britons into the streets to protest against the build-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. During Tuesdays debate in parliament several lawmakers accused Russia of committing war crimes in Syria. Johnson was responding to a question from Labour member of parliament Ann Clwyd who called for protests by millions of people outside Russian embassies worldwide. ""I would therefore call once again on everyone who cares about the plight of Syrian civilians to picket the Russian embassy in London and in capitals around the world from today"" she said. ""Two million three million four million people. It can be done. It has been done in the past."" Andrew Mitchell a former international development minister said British aircraft could help enforce a no-fly zone to prevent Russian bombing raids. ""The international community has an avowed responsibility to protect and that protection must be exerted"" the member of parliament from Prime Minister Theresa Mays governing Conservative Party said. ""If that means confronting Russian airpower defensively on behalf of the innocent people on the ground who we are trying to protect then we should do that."" Mitchell compared Russias actions to those of Nazi forces during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. Russia has been waging a punishing aerial bombing campaign in Syria for more than a year in support of President Bashar al-Assads forces part of a multi-front war that has claimed some 300000 lives and seen Moscow further estranged from the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday cancelled a visit to France in a furious row over Moscows role in the Syrian conflict. The announcement from the Kremlin came a day after French President Francois Hollande said Syrian forces had committed a ""war crime"" in the battered city of Aleppo with the support of Russian air strikes. Moscow yesterday hit out at Johnson for accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Syria dismissing his comments as ""Russophobic hysteria."" Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Johnsons ""accusing Russia of all mortal sins"" was just a ""storm in a teacup."" ""The Russophobic hysteria that is regularly fueled by certain members of the British establishment has not been taken seriously for a long time"" he said. Konashenkov said the Russian air force was not responsible for the bombing of a U.N. convoy in the Aleppo region last month and accused Britain of withholding the evidence it says it has against Russia. ""The alleged evidence you say you have wont be worth a penny if it is made available to everyone"" he said.

1924058200,At least 23 killed in regime strikes in Aleppo as UN meets over Syria,"Published September 25 2016 At least 23 civilians have been killed in renewed regime airstrikes on the contested city of Aleppo Syrian activists said Sunday as France and Britains Foreign Ministers raised the prospect of investigating Russia for war crimes ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about the spiraling violence in Syria. Medical workers and local officials reported airstrikes on neighborhoods throughout Aleppos opposition-held eastern districts as an announced regime offensive entered its fourth day. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 23 civilians had been killed by 6 p.m. and said it expects the toll to rise. Ibrahim Alhaj of the Syrian Civil Defense search and rescue outfit said hospitals and rescuers have documented the deaths of 43 people so far. Hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties and medical workers are expecting many of the wounded to die from a lack of treatment according to Mohammad Zein Khandaqani a member of the Medical Council which oversees medical affairs in the opposition areas. ""Ive never seen so many people dying in once place"" he said from a hospital in the city. ""Its terrifying today. In less than one hour the Russian planes have killed more than 50 people and injured more than 200."" The Observatory which relies on a network of contacts inside Syria said earlier in the day that 213 civilians have been killed by airstrikes and shelling on opposition areas in and around Aleppo since a U.S.-Russian brokered cease-fire collapsed Monday evening. At the U.N. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russia should be investigated for war crimes following an attack on a Syrian aid convoy that claimed 20 lives Monday. Johnson said that Russias air force may have deliberately targeted the civilian convoy on Sept. 19. Russia denies involvement and instead suggests the Syrian opposition or a U.S. drone were responsible. Frances Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran will be guilty of war crimes if they dont pressure Bashar Assad to stop escalating violence. Ayrault said an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting Sunday is a ""moment of truth"" for the U.N. The meeting was requested by the United States Britain and France as pro-regime forces extend their bombardment of the contested city of Aleppo. They are widely believed to be accompanied by Russian air strikes. Assad has rallied Syrias minorities behind his regime behind fears of a Sunni-dominated rebellion. The U.S. Britain and France are aligned on the Security Council against Russia and China which back Assad in the countrys protracted war now in its sixth year. But a broad coalition of Syrian rebels denounced international negotiations for peace as ""meaningless"" earlier Sunday. The statement released jointly by 33 factions called on the government and Russian forces to halt airstrikes and lift sieges on opposition areas. The U.N. estimates 600000 Syrians are trapped in various sieges enforced by the regime and Daesht across the country. ""Negotiations under the present conditions are no longer useful and are meaningless"" the statement said. The factions said they would not accept to have Russia mediate any negotiations calling it a ""partner to the regime in the crimes against our people."" The statement was signed by some of the largest factions from across Syria but did not include the powerful ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham nor the al-Qaida-linked Fatah Sham Front. Efforts to revive the truce have floundered. An airstrike destroyed a U.N.-backed humanitarian convoy Monday inside opposition territory shortly after the Syrian regime military announced the agreement had expired. The U.N. says the attack could amount to a war crime if proven deliberate though it has not assigned responsibility yet. The U.S. says it believes Russian jets were behind the strikes. The opposition Sunday retook an area in Aleppo that fell to regime forces the day before extending a punishing stalemate in the contested northern city. The Observatory says the opposition seized Handarat a largely uninhabited former Palestinian refugee camp early Sunday a day after it was lost to government forces. The camp has changed hands multiple times and is largely devastated and abandoned. The area is near Castello Road a vital supply route to the citys besieged opposition-held areas. Regime forces seized the Castello Road earlier this year besieging opposition-held districts where some 250000 people reside.",dailysabah,9/6/2016,aleppo,0

Three schools were targeted by Russian aircrafts earlier this morning in the town of Ain Jara in rural Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the international community must act quickly against Russias flagrant crimes against the Syrian people including children women and the elderly.

The silence of the international community over the crimes of the Assad regime and its allies against Syrian civilians as well as its complete disregard for their blood is a shameful stain on humanity.

The Coalition rejected any and all excuses used to justify the bombings in Syria stressing that targeting civilians including women and children cannot not be justified by fighting terror. Whether it was with a knife or an aircraft any attack on civilians is terrorism pure and simple the Coalition added. Meanwhile over 10 civilians were also killed and 18 more wounded in Russian airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks on the neighborhoods of Karam Alnozha and Tal Alzarazir in Aleppo on Tuesday.

1926479037,Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria,August 21 2013 Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria. Saudi Arabia called on Wednesday for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss reports of a chemical attack that opposition groups say killed hundreds of people in Syria. It is time for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and overcome differences between its members and restore the confidence of the international community by convening immediately to issue a clear and deterrent resolution that will put an end to this human crisis Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said in a statement. Leading Syrian opposition figure George Sabra said in Turkey the attack in which chemical weapons were used had killed 1300 people. Syria described the reports its army had used chemical weapons as completely untrue. Video footage from districts east of Damascus showed people choking some of them foaming at the mouth and many bodies with no signs of injuries. Prince Saud whose country has been a major supporter of rebels fighting to topple Assad also urged European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels to discuss the Syrian crisis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... warns that continuing to shy away from responsibility in dealing with the Syrian crisis will lead to more of these tragedies he said. A U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and government forces have used chemical weapons in the past. The Swedish scientist leading the team Ake Sellstrom said the latest reports should be looked into but doing so would require a request from a U.N. member state.

Rockets also hit the nearby district of Qaboun to the north where rebel fighters have repelled attempts by loyalist forces to overrun the area and the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp area to the south the activists added. Speaking from Ghouta activist Khaled Amer said explosions from rockets hitting Zamalka were being heard. In Jobar a Damascus neighborhood only 3 km (2 miles) from the historic center of the ancient capital explosions were heard at an army fortification and another compound housing tanks apparently from a rebel attack on the facilities. Fadi al-Shami of the Tarhrir al-Sham Brigade which operates in the eastern Ghouta region said scattered fighting was taking place along the Jobar-Zamalka axis and that opposition forces have moved closer to loyalist lines partly to be in safer positions in case of another chemical attack.

High-explosive parachute-retarded bombs were used in the airstrikes launched in a joint attack by the Assad regime and Russian air forces. The Syrian Coalition condemned this heinous crime against schoolchildren and civilians. In a statement released following the attack the Coalition stressed that the deliberate targeting of civilians using high-explosive weapons is clearly aimed at killing as many people as possible; causing mayhem; forcing civilians to leave their homes; and forcing them to agree to local truces out of the framework of the political process. Responsibility for this heinous crime lies with the international community as world leaders and active members of the United Nations continue to ignore these war crimes thus risk further fueling the conflict and undermining all chances of a political solution the Coalition added. The Coalition earlier said that the United Nations continues to ignore Russias crimes and its violations of international law urging it to make a thorough and real reconsideration of its positions and performance on Syria after the election of a new secretary-general.

Opposition forces in Syria exploded bombs in tunnels under Aleppo late on Tuesday and killed at least 13 fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the northern city a group tracking the violence said. The bombs were placed in two tunnels running under historic parts of the city close to an old police station said the Observatory a Britain-based group which reports on Syria using a network of sources on the ground. The attack appeared to have been carried out by Islamic brigades fighting Assad it said. The blast killed government soldiers and other forces fighting alongside them the Observatory added without giving details. Syrias state news agency made no mention of the attack. Aleppo is one of Syrias main contested cities and government forces took strategic ground around it in June squeezing the main rebel supply line into the city after months of battlefield gains by Damascus. The government advance was backed by fighters from the Lebanese Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah an ally of President Bashar al-Assad sources close to the group told Reuters earlier this month. Rebels advanced into Aleppo once Syrias commercial hub in 2012 from the north and took districts in the center of the city. The army has since mainly held the west and south of Aleppo but has been unable to push out opposition fighters. Forces loyal to Assad now control most of Damascus along with the main highway from the capital through to Homs and the western Mediterranean coast. Opposition fighters including a powerful al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State control much of the desert in the north and east.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.

The bombings destroyed 4 health facilities a power station a school and a mosque. The Coalition criticized the lack of serious UN action to force an immediate halt to the military operations by the Assad regime and Russian forces and to force the Assad regime to immediately lift the blockades on besieged areas.

1926479120,Assad Regime Escalates Attacks on Besieged Alwaer District in Homs to Force Residents out,Monday 07 November 2016 19:02 Assad Regime Escalates Attacks on Besieged Alwaer District in Homs to Force Residents out. Activists in the district of Alwaer in Homs said that at least 6 civilians were killed and dozens more injured in shelling by regime forces on the neighborhood on Sunday. Regime forces shelled the besieged district with explosive cylinders rockets and heavy artillery targeting mainly residential areas. The Homs Media Center said the Assad regime is escalating attacks on Alwaer after a two-month period hiatus following a truce reached between residents of the district and regime forces. The Syrian Coalition said that the Assad regimes latest escalation in Alwaer is part of a systematic plan to force residents of Alwaer to leave their homes and bring about a demographic change in the area. Activists in Alwaer said that the regimes shelling caused several buildings to collapse adding that regime forces encircling the district prevented the evacuation of the wounded for treatment despite pleas by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. The activists urged residents of the district not to send their children to schools on Monday for fear of their safety and to stay away from the areas exposed to the regimes snipers. The Syrian Coalition earlier stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. It warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes. The Coalition has repeatedly called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people.

1926479123,Islamic State killed 270 in Syrian gas field battle: monitor,July 19 2014 Islamic State killed 270 in Syrian gas field battle: monitor. Militant group Islamic State killed 270 soldiers guards and staff when they captured a Syrian gas field on Thursday in the bloodiest clash yet between the al Qaeda offshoot and President Bashar al-Assads forces a monitoring group said on Saturday. The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Thursday that 90 people had been killed and that many were missing after the attack against the Shaar gas field east of Homs in central Syria. But on Saturday the Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through a network of sources in the country on both sides quoted trusted sources as saying that the Islamic State had killed and executed 270 people during the assault. It said at least 40 Islamic State fighters were killed in the offensive. Islamic State has made rapid gains in Syria mostly by seizing territory from rival rebel groups using weaponry brought in from Iraq where last month it managed to take large areas from government forces. It was not immediately possible to verify the Observatorys report. Syrian state media made no mention of the attack. About 30 people had managed to escape to the nearby Hajjar field the Observatory report added. Activists say the Syrian air force has in recent weeks stepped up attacks on positions held by Islamic State formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Islamic State fighters have previously taken control of oilfields in Iraq as well as in Syrias eastern Deir al-Zor province. The group was once the Iraqi affiliate of al Qaeda but al Qaeda disowned it in February after tensions mounted over its expansion into Syria. Islamic State has declared a caliphate in the areas where it operates in Iraq and Syria. There the group has imposed Islamic law carrying out harsh penalties including several executions. In Raqqa in eastern Syria two women were stoned to death for adultery the Observatory said. One was killed on Friday and one on Saturday according to the report which could not immediately be corroborated. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias conflict which started as a peaceful protest movement in 2011 but descended into a multifaceted civil war after a government crackdown.

1926479125,France seeks U.N. resolution on Syria chemical arms.,September 10 2013 France seeks U.N. resolution on Syria chemical arms. France sought to seize the diplomatic initiative on Syria on Tuesday saying it would push for a U.N. resolution setting out terms for the destruction of its chemical weapons and warning of serious consequences if it resisted. The announcement by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius came a day after a surprise proposal by Russia that its Syrian ally hand over its chemical weapons stocks in a move that could avert possible U.S. military strikes. Fabius said the proposed resolution would be under Chapter 7 of the U.N.s charter covering the possible use of military action to restore peace and would require Damascus to reveal without delay the extent of its chemical program and place it under international control for dismantlement. The Russian foreign minister made an offer ... This cannot be used as a maneuver to divert us said Fabius whose country has been a strong backer of action including possible strikes against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assads forces. That is why we have decided to take this initiative. France will put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council in this sense and the procedure starts today. All options remain on the table he added. Western officials have expressed skepticism about the Russian proposal fearing it could simply be a delaying tactic aimed at averting strikes but offering no real prospect of resolving a civil war which sprung from a March 2011 uprising. The draft resolution would include an explicit condemnation of an August 21 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus which the United States says came from Assads forces and killed more than 1400 people. It would also contain a call for those behind the attack to be punished at the International Criminal Court. Fabius said he was looking to schedule visits to China later this week and Russia early next week for talks with the two veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.

The Syrian Coalition said that Russia has lost its credibility as a sponsor of negotiations. The Coalition said that Russia proves day after day it cannot claim to be a guarantor of the political process in Syria as it is directly complicit in the crimes and terrorism perpetrated against the Syrian people. The Coalition stressed that the latest political developments and the situation on the ground clearly show that every time Russia declares a temporary truce in Syria it is the first to violate it through airstrikes carried out by its forces or those of the Assad regime. On Wednesday Russias Defense Ministry declared a 48-hour truce in Aleppo set to begin on Thursday night with the aim of reducing violence and stabilizing the situation in the city. Russian and Regime forces soon violated the truce. Activists said they recorded no fewer than 30 beaches during the first 24 hours. Over 85 civilians were killed in aerial and artillery bombardments by Russian and regime forces on the city of Aleppo and its surrounding towns and villages on Thursday. Breaches of the 48-hour truce recorded included: 20 by Russian forces 13 by regime forces 2 by the PYD militia and 1 by Iranian-backed foreign militias.

1926479140,Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre,Wednesday 24 August 2016 16:58 Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre. The Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to re-open the file of the Ghouta Massacre and refer it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to determine perpetrators of the massacre and bring them to justice so as to make sure such a heinous crime cannot be repeated. Reports by independent human rights groups indicated that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons 136 times since the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2118 on September 27 2013 under which Assads declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the Assad regime would not have used banned weapons against Syrian civilians had it not been for its total disregard for the international community as well as its sense of protection and impunity. The Syrian Coalition denounced the extraordinary claims made by the Assad regimes UN representative Bashar Aljaafari who on Monday blamed France for the Ghouta Massacre that claimed the lives of over 1127 civilians a third of them women and children. The Coalition said Aljaafaris claims showed the utmost disregard for the victims of the Ghouta Massacre and are a desperate attempt to deny Assads responsibility for the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Following the massacre the Assad regime surrendered its cache of chemical weapons under the threat of UN sanctions and the use of force by the United States. Over the past three years the Assad regime has persistently denied responsibility for the Ghouta Massacre while seeking to blame opposition groups. However probes by the United Nations and international organizations produced a mass of evidence and facts pointing to the Assad regimes direct responsibility for the chemical attack on eastern Ghouta.

1926479150,Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province,Tuesday 14 November 2017 Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemns the brutal crime which was committed by aircraft of the Russian occupation forces in the town of Atareb in western rural Aleppo on Monday November 13. Initial reports indicated that over 40 civilians were killed and hundreds more were injured when Russian jets fired vacuum missiles on a popular market in the town. Russia which has used every possible means to undermine the will of the Syrian people and impose devious schemes and projects on them continues to wriggle out of its commitments and obligations towards the de-escalation zones agreement. Instead of honoring its role as a so-called guarantor of the agreement Russia bombed a popular market that was full of civilians in the town of Atareb in broad daylight destroying dozens of houses and buildings though no rebel groups were stationed in the town which is under the authority of a civilian council and a local police force. Instead of changing its positions and exerting pressure on the Assad regime to force it to seriously participate in the Geneva process and abide by UN Security Council resolutions and engage in direct and serious negotiations this crime one again demonstrated that Russia is unwilling to change its stance. The crime has also proved that Russia is determined to side with the Assad regime; continue with the war crimes Against the Syrian people; and that it is not interested in stopping its crime nor forcing its allies to stop the crimes they are committing against the Syrian people. The Syrian Coalition holds Russia directly and fully responsible for the war crimes it has committed in Syria since the beginning of its direct military intervention in Syria as well as for the crimes of genocide and the Assad regimes use of chemical weapons and other internationally prohibited weapons. The Coalition calls on the UN Security Council to condemn this massacre and its perpetrators as well as to prosecute them by all possible means as war criminals and to take serious action to protect Syrian civilians from these continued massacres.

Activists in Deir Ezzor said that nearly 58 people including women and children were killed in mutual shelling between regime forces and ISIS militants on the city and its countryside on Wednesday. The plight of civilians in Deir Ezzor is further aggravated as a result of the lack of basic needs including food and medicine. In Deir Ezzor civilians are trapped in a cycle of violence where Russian and regime air forces raid ISIS-held neighborhoods in the city and the extremist group shells the regime-held parts with rockets and mortar rounds. Recent airstrikes by the Assad regime jets targeted civilians queuing at a bakery in the neighborhood of Alommal causing dozens of casualties. The ISIS terrorist group has laid a siege on the regime-held parts of Deir Ezzor since early 2014. ISIS militants prevent civilians from entering regime-held parts while regime forces prevent civilians from leaving parts of the city under their control. Member of the Syrian Coalition Hussein Albuseis condemned the crimes committed by the Assad regime and its allies as well as by ISIS against civilians in Deir Ezzor. He called upon the international community to step up support for the local FSA and rebel groups to enable them oust ISIS and the Assad regime from all Deir Ezzor province. Albuseis pointed out that nearly 200 000 civilians trapped in Deir Ezzor have been suffering a double siege by the Assad regime and ISIS warning of a humanitarian disaster should the citys civilian population be left prey to the barbarity of the Assad regime and ISIS. He expressed hope that these appeals will not fall on deaf ears and prompt an immediate response from the internationally community. Dozens of civilians have starved to death since ISIS tightened the siege on Deir Ezzor in early 2014. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter,etilaf,8/25/2016,deir ezzor,0

The Syrian government should have granted United Nations inspectors access to the site of an alleged gas attack John Kerry reportedly told Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem in a call on Saturday. Kerry called to make clear that if as they claimed the Syrian regime has nothing to hide it should have allowed immediate and unimpeded access to the site rather than continuing to attack the affected area to block access and destroy evidence a State Department was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Syrian opposition groups have accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching massive chemical attacks near Damascus on August 21 and killing as many as 1300 people. Infographic: Chemical weapons claims (Design by Farwa Rizwan / Al Arabiya English) The Syrian government has strongly denied those allegations but has yet to accede to demands that U.N. inspectors already in the country be allowed to visit the sites of the alleged attacks AFP news agency reports. The secretary further emphasized ... that he had received full assurances from Free Syrian Army commanders that they would ensure the safety of U.N. investigators into the targeted areas the official said. In all these calls the secretary emphasized the importance of quickly determining the facts and underscored the seriousness and gravity of any chemical weapons use the official said.

1926479159,Dozens Killed in Intensified Russian & Regime Airstrikes on Idlib,Friday 22 July 2016 Dozens Killed in Intensified Russian & Regime Airstrikes on Idlib. Activists said that at least 10 civilians were killed and 50 wounded in airstrikes by Russian forces on Idlib city on Friday morning. The civil administration of Idlib on Thursday announced the full mobilization of the emergency medical services to cope with the high number of casualties among residents of the city and its countryside following a brutal wave of airstrikes by Russian jets that left at least 38 civilians killed and dozens more wounded. The most violent airstrikes targeted civilian neighborhoods of Idlib city as well as the towns of Tal Minnis Sarmada and Maaret Alnouman. Vice-president of the Syrian Coalition Muwaffaq Nyrabiya said that military escalation against civilians by the Assad regime and Russian forces comes as the date set by the United Nations for the start the transitional process in Syria nears. Nyrabiya said that such an escalation reinforced doubts repeatedly raised by the Syrian Coalition about the willingness of Russia and the Assad regime to engage seriously in the political process. Nyrabiya pointed out that Russias actions in Syria demonstrate it is insistent on pursuing a military solution in Assads favor. Russias actions however will not weaken the resolve of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition to reclaim freedom and dignity and build a civil state based on inclusivity and the rule of law he stressed. Nyrabiya called on all rebel and FSA groups to reconsider their strategies and lend an ear to calls for them to pull out of Idlib and assign the task of managing the affairs in the city to the local council and the free police forces. The intensified Russian airstrikes on Idlib prompted an exodus of civilians towards the surrounding cities towns and farmlands. Secondary education exams were also postponed as a result of the airstrikes and Friday prayers cancelled in all of the citys mosques. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter,etilaf,8/20/2013,idlib,0
1926479161,Russian Airstrikes Hit MSF Hospital in Idlib,Monday 15 February 2016 Russian Airstrikes Hit MSF Hospital in Idlib. A hospital supported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the town of Maaret al-Nouman in rural Idlib was hit earlier today by Russian air airstrikes. At least seven people were killed and many more wounded in the deliberate attack on the hospital. The hospital was completely destroyed and the fate of at least eight members of staff is still unknown. The Syrian Coalition condemned the attack saying it is not the first hospital to be targeted by Russian warplanes. Russia has targeted civilian neighborhoods medical centers schools and houses of worship. This crime will not be the last as long as the international community keeps silent and shirks its responsibility to respond to them. While we hold Moscow fully responsible for these crimes we warn that the international communitys continued inaction serves as an incentive for Russia to commit more crimes in Syria. Russias acts in Syria will not only negatively affect the political process but will also encourage the spread of terrorism the Syrian Coalition stressed. The Syrian Coalition called upon the ceasefire task force formed as part of the Munich agreement not to ignore the horrible crimes Russia continues to commit against the Syrian people. These crimes would undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement to the conflict. The continued silence over Russias behavior in Syria undoubtedly represents complicity in these crimes and would ruin what has been achieved in Munich the Coalition said. These ongoing crimes especially after the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2254 and the signing off on the Munich agreement undermine all chances of restoring trust in the international community. They cast doubt about the international communitys ability to find a real political solution to end the tragedy unfolding in Syria the Coalition added.

The Syrian Coalition condemned the war crimes the Iranian militias are committing against civilians in Aleppo stressing that the international community bears responsibility for these crimes as it failed to prevent them. Activists in Aleppo said that the Iranian militias summarily executed six young men in the neighborhood of Sakhour on Friday after those men returned to their homes in eastern Aleppo which completely fell to regime forces. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Yasser Farhan said that the Free Syrian Army and forces of the Syrian revolution will continue to resist the Russian and Iranian invaders until they are ousted from of all Syrian territory. Activists in rural Aleppo said that the Assad regime and Russian air forces having finished the brutal bombing campaign on eastern Aleppo carried out intense airstrikes on western Aleppo over the past two days. Six civilians from one family were killed in airstrikes on the town of Atareb west of Aleppo on Saturday. Regime forces have also significantly escalated aerial and artillery bombardment on Wadi Barada valley northwest of Damascus pounding the rebel-held enclave with tens of barrel bombs and airstrikes over the past two days. Farhan stressed that the international community has a responsibility to stop such crimes pointing out that Russia is still not able to control the situation in Syria or sponsor any peace process. Farhan raised questions about the UN Security Council resolution passed earlier this week which called for the deployment of UN observers in Aleppo. He said that the latest resolution has not yet been implemented just as earlier UNSC resolutions on Syria which called for stopping attacks on civilians; unhindered delivery of aid to besieged and hard-to-reach areas; and the release of detainees were not implemented.

1926479178,Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

1926479179,French FM: all indications Syria behind chemical attack,Saturday 24 August 2013 French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Saturday that all indications show that Syrias government was behind a chemical massacre near Damascus that the opposition claims killed hundreds. All the information at our disposal converges to indicate that there was a chemical massacre near Damascus and that the Bashar regime is responsible Fabius said on a visit to Ramallah in the West Bank. Opponents of Bashar al-Assad said the presidents forces killed 1300 people when they unleased chemical weapons east and southwest of Damascus in the attacks on Wednesday. U.N.

The Syrian government has strongly denied accusations it carried out the attacks but so far it has not said whether it will let U.N. inspectors visit the sites. Fabius arrived early Saturday on a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories aimed at encouraging recently resumed peace talks his office said.,arabiya,8/24/2013,damascus,0

1926479206,Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians,Saturday 20 August 2016 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians. The Syrian Coalition called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Assad regime backed by Russia and allied forces continues with the campaign of terror against the Syrian people. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people. Activists in northern rural Homs said that the Assad regime and Russian forces have recently intensified aerial attacks on rebel-held areas. At least 13 civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in airstrikes by regime and Russian fighter jets on the town of Alghantou on Friday. Airstrikes also targeted the nearby towns of Rastan Talbeesah Ter Maaleh and Zafarana. Meanwhile Albir hospital and civilian homes in the district of Alwaer in Homs were subject to intense regime shelling on Friday with reports of civilian casualties.

The Coalition stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. The coalition warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter,etilaf,8/20/2016,homs,1
1926479207,Syrian Coalition Decries the US-led Alliances Silence over Al Raqqa Massacre,Thursday 27 November 2014 Syrian Coalition Decries the US-led Alliances Silence over Al Raqqa Massacre. Nasr al-Hariri Secretary General of the Syrian Coalition decries the silence of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition over Al Raqqa massacre in which dozens of civilians were killed by Assads air force. The world chose to remain silent over one of Assads most horrible massacres committed not only against the people of Al Raqqa but against all humanity. Over 130 civilians were killed and hundreds wounded when Assads air force carried out nine air raids on the city. The US-led coalitions lack of clear and coherent strategy on Syria would risks throwing many disappointed Syrians in the arms of extremist groups not out of conviction of their fanatic principles but out of the growing frustration over the failure of the international community to offer them a better alternative. Hariri also said that it is strange how the US-led coalitions warplanes rushed to punish the criminals who killed the US journalist James Foley but insists on ignoring Assads warplanes have killed thousands of children and women. The basic principle in the charters of Human Rights is that punishment is based on the type and characterization of the crime not on the nature of the offender. The Syrians will not accept this duality that has so far characterized the strategy of the US-led coalition which is avenging the killing of Western citizens but turn a blind eye to the killing of hundreds of thousands Syrians at the hands of the Assad regime. Moreover fighting terrorism in Syrian and the region piecemeal will not eliminate the threat of terrorism which swept the region with the direct support of Assad and his Iranian allies. Hariri pointed out that the bombing that targeted Al Raqqa yesterday is not random at all but a systematic and collective punishment inflicted on civilians.

1926479215,Security Council seeks clarity on chemical weapons reports in Syria,Wednesday 21 August 2013 Security Council seeks clarity on chemical weapons reports in Syria. The U.N. Security Council said on Wednesday that it is seeking clarity on reports suggesting that Syrian regime forces killed 1300 people using chemical weapons. There must be clarity on what happened and the situation must be followed carefully Argentinas envoy Maria Cristina Perceval said after the council met behind closed doors adding that members welcomed the determination of the secretary general to ensure a thorough impartial investigation. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moons office had said he was shocked by the reports and that U.N. weapons experts in Syria to probe previous allegations were in discussions with Damascus according to AFP. Security Council members France Britain the United States Luxembourg and South Korea had called for the meeting which was held behind closed doors. Diplomats said the joint letter cited credible reports of the use of chemical weapons. We urge you to do all you can to ensure that the mission has urgent access to all relevant sites and sources of information the letter said. The United States called for immediate access to the site of the alleged chemical attack. We are working urgently to gather additional information said White House spokesman Josh Earnest in a statement expressing deep concern over the reports. International action was expected to be limited with permanent U.N. member Russia standing firmly by the Assads regime. Russia hastened to back up denials from the Assads administration by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit him according to Reuters. Neighboring Israels Channel 10 television quoted Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon as telling reporters that Syria had used chemical weapons and not for the first time. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that already in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention that rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. If confirmed a major gas attack could increase pressure on Obama to do more to support rebels whose links to militant Islam have helped dampen Western enthusiasm for their cause.

1926479219,Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes,September 9 2013 Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes. President Barack Obamas request for congressional authorization for military strikes against Syria is set to dominate the Congress this week and next with the outcome in doubt. Obama is seeking backing for the strikes in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21. Washington blames the Syrian government for the attack which it says kills more than 1400 people. Here are the important steps in Congress: - On Monday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid began moving to limit debate on the motion to proceed to a resolution authorizing the use of military force. The motion to proceed is the mechanism for bringing legislation before the full Senate. It is not yet clear whether opponents will allow a simple majority vote on this procedural step or insist on a more difficult 60-vote majority in the 100-member chamber in which Obamas Democrats control 54 seats. This first test vote is now set for Wednesday. - On Monday evening many members of Congress will receive a classified briefing from administration and military officials. For scores of lawmakers this will be their first inside look at the Syria situation. - Reid in consultation with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell will likely decide how many and which amendments to the bill will be debated on the Senate floor. - Obama is due to lunch on Tuesday with Senate Democrats in an attempt to sway enough of them to support a military strike. - He then plans a speech to the nation on Tuesday night which could be a defining moment. Many undecided members of the Senate and House are likely to make up their minds on how they will vote after that speech and into Wednesday. - If the Senate votes to debate the resolution itself opponents could erect another procedural hurdle that would require 60 votes to limit this debate. Should those votes prove necessary and if Reid succeeds in rounding them up a vote on passing the Syria resolution could come on Thursday or Friday. A simple majority vote in favor of the bill would send it to the House for consideration. - The House could simply vote for or against the Senate-passed bill. Or it could amend the bill pass it and send it back to the Senate for approval. Another option though one that seems less likely now is for a House committee to write its own bill for debate in the 435-member House. In any event it could be next week before the full House takes action.

1926479220,Syrias Assad regime likely responsible for chemical attack: rights group,September 10 2013 Syrias Assad regime likely responsible for chemical attack: rights group Reuters Staff. Evidence strongly suggests Syrian government forces were responsible for a poison gas attack that killed more than 1400 people Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday contradicting repeated denials by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S.-based rights group in a report issued in New York said it had reached its conclusion after analyzing witness accounts information of the likely source of the attacks remnants of the weapons used and medical records of victims. The evidence concerning the type of rockets and launchers used in these attacks strongly suggests that these are weapon systems known and documented to be only in the possession of and used by Syrian government armed forces Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch and arms experts monitoring the use of weaponry in Syria have not documented Syrian opposition forces to be in possession of the 140mm and 330mm rockets used in the attack or their associated launchers. The chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21 killed more than 1400 people. Syria has been torn by a bitter civil conflict between Assads troops and rebel forces who want to end the Assad familys four-decade rule. The Human Rights Watch report comes as the United States pushes for congressional approval for military strikes on Syria and as U.S. President Barack Obama explores a Russian proposal to put Syrias chemical weapons under international control. Obama has argued that Assad must be punished for the use of poison gas on rebel areas but his plan faces significant resistance from U.S. lawmakers who are worried that a strike could draw the U.S. into the conflict and spark wider conflicts in the Middle East. Assad in an interview on the U.S. CBS television network denied there was any evidence to link his government to the gas attack and warned the United States to expect reprisals for any military strike on his country. Human Rights Watch said it also investigated suggestions the chemical attacks came from opposition forces. Human Rights Watch has investigated alternative claims that opposition forces themselves were responsible for the August 21 attacks and has found such claims lacking in credibility and inconsistent with the evidence found at the scene.

President Barack Obama said on Thursday he is shifting his focus to domestic priorities from a tense period during which he sought congressional approval to use military force against Syria for its suspected use of chemical weapons. Even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue and making sure that international attention is focused on the horrible tragedy that occurred there it is still important to recognize that weve got a lot more stuff to do here in this government the president said before a meeting with his Cabinet at the White House. The president said he hopes meetings between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will result in action to eliminate Syrias ability to use chemical weapons again. Obama has asked Congress to authorize military strikes against Syria in response to what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack by the government that killed more than 1400 people on August 21. The issue is on hold pending diplomatic efforts to disarm Syria of chemical weapons. I am hopeful that the discussions that Secretary Kerry had with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result Obama said. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a cabinet meeting in the West Wing of the White House in Washington September 12 2013. REUTERS/Jason Reed Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were to hold talks on Syria in Geneva. The president cited the budget immigration and implementation of his signature healthcare legislation as concerns he is turning to. The administration faces daunting obstacles on all three fronts and a ticking clock on the budget in particular. Congressional Republicans have sought to eliminate funding for the health law known as Obamacare and want the president to agree to spending cuts in exchange for raising the nations debt limit. Lawmakers must pass legislation to continue funding for government operations by the end of the month or force a government shutdown. Failure to raise the nations debt limit after a date expected in mid-October would trigger a debt default. The administration is also scrambling to make sure Americans lacking health coverage sign up for insurance under the new law starting October 1. Were going to focus on some specific issues including managing some of the budget debates that are going to take place over the next several weeks Obama said.

1926479236,U.N. inspectors to visit Syria chemical attacks sites,Thursday 1 August 2013 U.N. inspectors to visit Syria chemical attacks sites. U.N. inspectors will go to Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks have been reported the United Nations said Wednesday. The Syrian government has blocked the inspectors since calling for a U.N. inquiry into the use of the banned arms in March. The mission will travel to Syria as soon as possible to contemporaneously investigate three of the reported incidents said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. The announcement followed an accord reached with the Syrian government when two U.N. envoys went to Damascus last week. According to diplomats the inspectors are being assembled in Europe now and could go to Syria as soon as next week. The U.N. says that Syria Britain France and the United States have informed it of 13 alleged chemical weapons attacks during the 28-month-old conflict. While the initial inquiry will focus on three sites Nesirky said U.N. leader Ban Ki-moon remains mindful of other reported incidents and the mission will also continue to seek clarification from the member states concerned. The spokesman said the first sites to be visited will include Khan al-Assal near the Syrian city of Aleppo where the government reported a chemical weapons attack on March 19. It said at least 26 people including 16 government soldiers were killed. The government and its ally Russia have blamed Syrian rebels for the attack. The Syrian opposition says President Bashar al-Assads forces staged the attack. The other two sites to be visited by the inspectors are Ataybah near Damascus where a suspected attack was staged in March and Homs where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on December 23 diplomats said. Britain and France have submitted evidence to the United Nations on the Ataybah and Homs attacks which they say was carried out by the government. The Syrian government called for the U.N. inquiry in March. But it then blocked the U.N. inspectors insisting that they be limited to Khan al-Assal.

1926479237,Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa,December 19 2016 Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa. Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

1926479240,Syrian army Islamic State clash near army airport: monitor,July 18 2014 Syrian army Islamic State clash near army airport: monitor. Syrian soldiers clashed with Islamic State militants outside a government-controlled army airport on Friday a British-based monitoring group said part of a major escalation of fighting between the al Qaeda offshoot and the military. The hardline Sunni militants have gained ground in Syria over the past five weeks bolstered by equipment seized in a lightning offensive last month in neighbouring Iraq. On Thursday the group seized the Shaar oilfield east of the central city of Homs in what the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said was one of its bloodiest clashes with President Bashar al-Assads forces. On Friday the death toll from the raid rose to 115 the Observatory said. The fate of 250 others was unknown it said. A video posted online on Thursday purportedly of the battle site showed armed men pacing through a barren desert space speaking in Arabic and German as they reviewed what appeared to be more than 50 bodies many with gunshot wounds to the head chest and legs. Some of the bodies appeared to be young men. Here lie two pigs said one of the men speaking German. At least two multiple-rocket launchers and other military vehicles were visible. The Observatory an anti-Assad group which tracks the violence through a network of contacts in Syria said the government had sent reinforcements backed by helicopters to the nearby Hajjar oil field. In Raqqa province which borders Turkey a woman - sentenced to death for adultery by the Islamic State - was stoned to death the Observatory said. The report could not immediately be corroborated. MILITARY AIRPORT On Friday fighting also broke out between Islamic State militants and government forces at the army airport in Deir al-Zor one of the last major strategic locations in Deir al-Zor province not under the control of the Islamic State. The Syrian army responded to the militants offensive by bombing areas around the airport which supplies its forces in the east of the country the Observatory said. There were no details of casualties. The fighting was just a few hundred metres (yards) from the airport the Observatorys director Rami Abdurrahman said noting that it would be tough for the Islamic State to overcome government forces there. The Islamic State expelled rival rebels from Deir al-Zor city on Monday tightening its hold on the eastern province bordering Iraq. [ID:nL6N0PP2YH] Capturing most of Deir al-Zor province has helped the Islamic State link up territorial gains across Syria and Iraq where it seized the northern city of Mosul in June. Last month it also declared an Islamic caliphate in territory it controls in both countries. The group previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant follows al Qaedas hardline ideology but draws strength from foreign fighters many with experience in Iraq.

1926479251,135 Civilians Killed in Escalating Bombardment on Idlib in Last Three Days,Wednesday 07 December 2016 135 Civilians Killed in Escalating Bombardment on Idlib in Last Three Days. Activists in Idlib province said that at least 135 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks by the Assad regime and Russian forces on the province over the past three days. The bombardment targeted mainly public markets and residential buildings in a grave escalation in parallel with the ongoing brutal onslaught on Aleppo and its countryside. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Adnan Rahmoun condemned the escalating war crimes being committed by the Russian and Assad regime forces in Idlib and Aleppo. He lamented the lack of any response by the international community which is standing idly by as the Assad regime and Russia are committing these crimes using internationally banned weapons including vacuum bombs cluster bombs and white phosphorous. Rahmoun called upon the UN Security Council and the international community to put an end to the war crimes being committed by the Assad regime and its allies and to assume their responsibilities to protect civilians. He stressed that those who keep silent over war crime are partners to their perpetrators. Idlib administration on Monday announced it was suspending its work as a result of intensive aerial bombardment by the Russian and Assad regime air forces with the exception of civil defense and medical services. Idlib University and the Department of Education in Idlib also announced they were closing down until the weekend for fear of aerial bombardment.

The draft resolution was proposed by New Zealand Spain and Egypt. (Source: Syrian Coalitions Media Office) Twitter,etilaf,12/7/2016,idlib,0
1926479259,Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor,10 October 2017 Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor. Konashenkov said that over the past 24 hours Russias aerospace group dealt 182 strikes against the positions of ISIS terrorists who had infiltrated to Deir Ezzor province from Iraq. Two pairs of Sukhoi-34 bombers were commissioned to hit the targets. Fourteen consecutive strikes were made Konashenkov added. Objective monitoring means confirmed the destruction of four tanks three armored personnel carriers and nine off-road vehicles armed with heavy machineguns and two multiple rocket launchers. Fifty terrorists were killed and another 30 sealed off in the underground tunnels Konashenkov said. Forty minutes later a Sukhoi-34 bomber carried out another attack against this stronghold to kill another 20 terrorists who had arrived for evacuating those injured he added. The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed the economic infrastructure of ISIS in Syria and foiled any attempts by terrorists to resume the production and illegal sale of hydrocarbons in Syria. ISIS no longer has the sources of financing for purchasing weapons and ammunition and recruiting mercenaries in Syria he said. Konashenkov added a command center of ISIS and three groups of terrorists who had arrived from Iraq had been destroyed near Hatla town. The elimination of 34 terrorists five off-road vehicles carrying large caliber weapons and two trucks full of ammunition has been confirmed he said. Shaza/Mazen,sana,10/10/2017,deir ezzor,1
1926479260,World powers on right track on Syria chemical arms: Putin,October 2 2013 World powers on right track on Syria chemical arms: Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday global powers were on the right track with a plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons and could avert military intervention in the conflict if they worked together. Agreement on the plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons was reached after U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve air strikes to punish Syrias government over an August 21 gas attack the United States says killed more than 1400 people. There is every reason to believe we are on the right track Putin told an investment conference. He said the chemical weapons plan which has rekindled an effort to convene an international conference to seek a solution to the conflict could not have been put in place without support from Obama and the leaders of many countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the VTB Capital Investment Forum Russia Calling in Moscow October 2 2013. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov I believe that if we continue to act in such a coordinated way it will not be necessary to use force and increase the number of people wounded and killed in the long-suffering land of Syria said Putin. Russia has been Syrian President Bashar al-Assads strongest backer during the civil war blocking a number of Western initiatives in the U.N. Security Council and blaming the August 21 gas attack on rebel forces. Russia has emphasized that rebels fighting Assad must also abide by the chemical weapons agreement and made clear it would demand proof of government responsibility for any future attack before approving punishment in the Security Council.

1926479261,Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo.,Wednesday 30 November 2016 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Aleppo. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Aleppo by compelling the Assad regime to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Aleppo as the regime and its allies continue their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Aleppo and its countryside.Every hospital in Aleppo has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.Abdah noted that the Assad regime and his allies are turning the liberated areas of the city of Aleppo into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege.This outrageous escalation in Aleppo has killed more than 670 40% of them are children caused the displacement of more than 3000 families destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in the regimes long bloody record of barbarity.The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.The letter also stressed that the Assad regime can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies particularly Russia.As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Aleppo and to make sure that the regimes criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.

1926479264,Islamic State executed 700 people from Syrian tribe: monitoring group,August 17 2014 Islamic State executed 700 people from Syrian tribe: monitoring group. Oliver Holmes Suleiman Al-Khalidi. The Islamic State militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group and activists said on Saturday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zor province. The conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdelrahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Reuters cannot independently verify reports from Syria due to security conditions and reporting restrictions. Proclaiming a caliphate straddling parts of Iraq and Syria Islamic State has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes prompting the first U.S. air strikes in Iraq since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zor who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when Islamic State stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zor said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Those who were executed during the storming of the al-Sheitaat area are around 300. The rest were killed in the course of the battles he told Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect his identity. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias civil war which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against President Bashar al-Assad a member of the Shiite-derived Alawite minority backed by Shiite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions in Syria with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. Tribal powers in Syria and Iraq have had to make the choice between fighting Islamic State or pledging allegiance. On Friday a video posted on YouTube showed men who said they were from the al-Sheitaat towns of Kishkeih and Abu Hammam pledging full support for Islamic State. We say that what Islamic State stands for is justice a tribal member sitting in a room with dozens of other men said in a statement that was read out. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju called in a video message for other tribes to join them in the fight against the militants. We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If (Islamic State) are done with us the other tribes will be targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target he said in the video posted on YouTube. Islamic State was condemned on Friday in a U.N. Security Council resolution for gross systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law.

1926479274,U.S. leaves door open to new U.N. vote on Syria Arshad Mohammed,September 8 2013 U.S. leaves door open to new U.N. vote on Syria Arshad Mohammed. The United States left the door open on Sunday to seeking a United Nations Security Council resolution that could endorse punishing Syria for a chemical weapons attack last month and indicated Arab countries were seeking a tough response. Speaking to reporters after meeting Arab foreign ministers U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said many were leaning toward supporting a G20 statement - already signed by 12 nations including Saudi Arabia - that called for a strong international response following an August 21 chemical attack in Syria. Washington and Paris say forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were behind the attack in which more than 1400 are estimated to have been killed and they are considering air strikes to try to deter him from using such weapons again. Kerry told a news conference that Saudi Arabia which has been one of Assads most vocal opponents and diplomats say is one of the main suppliers of arms to the the Syrian rebels supported the strike and they support taking action. French President Francois Hollande increasingly under pressure at home and among European partners to seek a U.N. mandate before any military intervention in Syria suggested on Saturday he could seek a resolution at the Security Council despite previous Russian and Chinese vetoes. French officials say a draft resolution presented jointly by Britain and France at the end of August was not even read by Russia and China let alone discussed. U.N. inspectors are likely to hand in their report later this week as the U.S. Congress debates whether to allow limited strikes on Syria. NO DECISION BY OBAMA On President Hollandes comments with respect to the U.N. the president (Obama) and all of us are listening carefully to all of our friends Kerry said. No decision has been made by the president. After the news conference a U.S. official said Washington was not seeking a Security Council vote at the moment. We have always supported working through the U.N. but have been clear there is not a path forward there and we are not currently considering proposing another vote said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Kerrys meeting with Arab ministers including from Bahrain Egypt Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed talks in Lithuania with European foreign ministers who blamed the attack in Syria on Assad but urged waiting for the U.N. inspectors to report before any action. All of us agreed - not one dissenter - that Assads deplorable use of chemical weapons ... crosses an international global red line Kerry said alongside his Qatari counterpart Khaled al-Attiya. A number of countries immediately signed on to the G20 agreement that was reached by now 12 countries on the side of the G20 meeting and they will make their own announcements in the next 24 hours about that. Qatar has strongly backed the Syrian opposition. As for Syria and what Qatar is willing to provide Qatar is currently studying with its friends and the United Nations what it could provide in order to protect the Syrian people Attiya said without elaborating.

1926479276,Syrian Islamist insurgents launch battle to seize government-held Aleppo,July 2 2015 Syrian Islamist insurgents launch battle to seize government-held Aleppo. Syrian insurgents led by Islamist groups began a major offensive to gain full control of the divided northern city of Aleppo a monitor and rebels said on Thursday. The fall of Syrias main commercial hub would be a major blow for President Bashar al-Assad restricting his control mainly to a belt of territory stretching north from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast. This would deepen Syrias de facto partition between the Assad-run west and areas held by a patchwork of armed groups. A statement by the groups said their goal was to liberate the city of Aleppo and to ensure that when it fell into their hands it would be ruled by strict sharia principles. The British-based Observatory for Human Rights said a coalition of groups that included al Qaedas Syrian offshoot Nusra Front and Salafi Ahrar al Sham had fired hundreds of mortar bombs on locations in western districts of the city that are held by the Syrian army and allied militias. Much of the fighting was focused on the Jamiyat al-Zahra frontline where the insurgents struck the heavily defended part of the district held by the army according to Rami Abdul Rahman the head of the rights group which tracks the war. The Jamiyat al Zahra which houses several major security compounds has long been coveted by the rebels to allow them to advance into government-held areas and cut army supply lines. The latest flareup of fighting was the widest rebel offensive taking place simultaneously across most front lines since the insurgents took over most of the eastern part of the city in the summer of 2012 Abdul Rahman added. Eight civilians were killed with at least 70 injured with dozens of dead and injured from army personnel and allied militias the head of the monitor said. The Syrian army last month repelled a push by an alliance of rebels including recipients of Western aid fighting under the name of the Free Syrian Army into Aleppos Rashidin district. It was the first rebel advance into the heart of Aleppos government-controlled residential area in more than two years. Insurgents have also been bombarding government-held areas turning the tables after strikes by Syrian forces on insurgent-held parts of what was Syrias most populous city before it become a main battleground in the four-year civil war. Separately the sound of intense fighting including explosions could be heard from the Turkish border town of Kilis about 30 miles (48 km) north of the Syrian city of Azaz witnesses said. The Turkish army stepped up security on their side of the border including armored regiments and special forces following days of deploying troops and equipment to the area security sources said. The sources said the fighting in Azaz was between hardline Islamic State militants and a joint force of al-Nusra and Western-backed rebels who have clashing in northern Aleppo countryside in recent weeks.

1926479281,Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies,October 5 2017 Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies. Stephanie Nebehay. Syria is in the throes of its worst fighting since the battle for eastern Aleppo last year with heavy air strikes causing hundreds of civilian casualties aid agencies said on Thursday. Hospitals schools and people fleeing violence have been targeted by direct air strikes that may amount to war crimes the United Nations said without apportioning blame. Russia and a U.S.-led coalition are carrying out separate air strikes in Syria ostensibly aimed at defeating Islamic State militants. September was the deadliest month of 2017 for civilians with daily reports of attacks on residential areas resulting in hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in a statement. Air strikes killed dozens this week in Raqqa where 8000 people remain trapped and at least 149 people mostly women and children in residential areas of rebel-dominated Idlib province in Syrias northwest in the last 12 days of September he said. Explosions in Damascus killed 20 people and civilian casualties were also reported in rural areas around the Syrian capital and in Hama Aleppo and Deir al-Zor Moumtzis said again without saying who was responsible. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that up to 10 hospitals were reported to have been damaged in the past 10 days. We have seen a number of hospitals being targeted we got very worrying reports and converging reports about hospitals schools civilian infrastructure being targeted Robert Mardini ICRC regional director for the Middle East told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office. And of course this is outrageous unacceptable he said adding that damage to Sham hospital in Idlib alone had cut off half a million people from access to health care. The ICRC voiced alarm that violence was occurring in many of the de-escalation areas including Idlib rural Hama and eastern Ghouta. Taken together these are the worst levels of violence since the battle for Aleppo in 2016 it said. Hundreds of civilians killed is certainly a very conservative figure Mardini said. We see a very strong correlation between the escalation and the intensification in the fighting on one hand and the human cost of this conflict the attacks on health facilities and civilian infrastructure. Syrias six-year-old civil war pits President Bashar al-Assads government supported by Russia and Iran against a myriad number of rebel factions some Western-backed and Islamist militant groups. Military jets believed to be Russian killed at least 60 civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the oil-rich Deir al-Zor province when their small boats were targeted as they sought to cross the Euphrates River opposition activists former residents and a war monitor said late on Wednesday. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has carried out air strikes that have also caused civilian casualties which it says it goes to great lengths to avoid. The point here is not to point fingers Mardini said declining to identify suspected perpetrators of deadly strikes. What should be non-negotiable is the respect for the laws of war everywhere in Syria. This is absolutely critical today.

1926479289,Factbox: Syrias city of Hama site of new assault,August 1 2011 Factbox: Syrias city of Hama site of new assault. Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January.

Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens.

1926479296,ISIS attacks Kurdish-held town on Turkish border,Saturday 27 February 2016 ISIS attacks Kurdish-held town on Turkish border. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. ISIS militants launched an assault on a Kurdish-controlled town on Syrias border with Turkey on Saturday prompting air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition to try to drive them back. The hardline Sunni fighters attacked Tel Abyad which is controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the nearby town of Suluk in the early hours of Saturday YPG spokesman Redur Xelil and Turkish security sources told Reuters. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. The attack was launched hours after a cessation of hostilities came into effect under a U.S.-Russian plan although the temporary truce does not apply to ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front meaning the Syrian government Moscow and the coalition reserve the right to strike them. The truce appeared largely to be holding across much of Syria. Xelil said the YPG and Syrian Kurdish internal security forces were able to crush this attack and encircle the attackers although he gave no casualty toll. The YPG captured Tel Abyad from ISIS last year in an offensive backed by U.S.-led air strikes. The town lies north of Raqqa and had been a key supply line for the militant capital. The Turkish security sources said the attack was launched on two fronts and that the sound of gunfire and explosions audible from the town of Akcakale on the Turkish side had continued for several hours. Intermittent gunfire could still be heard. The security sources and a witness in Akcakale said war planes thought to be from the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS struck the militant positions and that the Turkish army had increased patrols on its side of the border. While not directly addressing the Tel Abyad attack 14 Turkish F-16s patrolled the Turkish-Syrian border on Friday Turkish military said. Xelil said some of the attackers infiltrated from the Turkish border to the north reiterating accusations that Turkey was supporting the group. Turkey has consistently denied those accusations and the security sources said recent measures to stop illegal crossings meant it was impossible that the attackers had entered from Turkey. Other attackers infiltrated from the south Xelil said. He said dozens of Islamic State fighters had been killed.,arabiya,2/27/2016,raqqa,0

1926479298,The Assad Regime & Chemical Weapons,1. Ghouta: On August 21 2013 the Assad regime fired rockets filled with Sarin gas on rebel-held Ghouta rural Damascus killing at least 1400 civilians including women and children. 2. Red lines: Western as well as Arab states condemned the attacks and as it was crossing a red line drawn earlier by US President Barack Obama the United States prepared for a punitive strike moving its warships in the Mediterranean closer to Syria. 3. Strikes: On October 9 2013 US Foreign Secretary John Kerry made a hint at the possibility of averting the strike if the Assad regime were to hand over its chemical arsenal. Early in September 2013 the United States and Russia reached the Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons which was endorsed later on by the UN Security Council with resolution 2118. 4. OPCW: On 15 November 2013 the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) decides: for all other declared chemicals: beginning of destruction as soon as possible with completion of destruction not later than 30 June 2014. The OPCW-UN Joint Mission was formally established on 16 October 2013. 5. Missed deadlines: Since then the Assad regime has been widely accused of dragging its feet having missed a series of deadlines including a deadline to ship the most lethal of chemical components out of Syria by the end of 2013 a February 5 2014 deadline to move all chemicals abroad for destruction and a deadline to destroy all of its chemical weapons production sites by 15 March 2014. 6. 15 poison gas attacks: The Assad regime has used poison gas at least 15 times in recent months. The OPCW announced on Tuesday April 29 2014 that it will send a fact-finding mission to investigate the recent use of chlorine gas in Syria. 7. Discrepancies: On June 4 2014 Reuters reported the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission Sigrid Kaag revealed during a briefing to the UN Security Council that there were discrepancies in the original declaration of the Assad regimes stockpile. This declaration suggests Assad might be able to keep chemical materials. 8. Chemical warheads: Recently activists reported that the regime keeps rockets with chemical warhead in a mountainous area west of the central city of Hama. 9. Warehouses & bunkers: Falling short of its international obligations the regime has proposed to seal off seven warehouses and five underground bunkers instead of dismantling them. Having discussed outstanding issues with the Assad regime experts from the OPCW-UN Joint Mission are supposed to brief the OPCWs executive council on their findings on June 17 in The Hague. 10. Missing June 30 deadline: In the eighth and latest letter from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council dated 23 May 2014 the UNSG observes: It is now evident that some activities related to the elimination of the chemical weapons program of the Syrian Arab Republic will continue beyond 30 June 2014.

1926479310,World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim,Wednesday 21 August 2013 World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim. World leaders have responded to the claim by activists in the Syrian Revolution General Commission that at least 640 people were killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region. The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. The chief of a U.N. inspectors team visiting Syria says he wants to look into the claims. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom says the high numbers of killed and wounded being reported sound suspicious. He told Swedish broadcaster SVT that this sounds like something we need to look into. Turkey also called on U.N. inspectors to look into Syrian rebel reports and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Light must immediately be shed on these claims and the United Nations mission that was formed to investigate chemical weapons claims in Syria should look into these claims and reveal its findings the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. If these allegations are found to be true it will be inevitable for the international community to take the necessary stance and give the necessary response to this savagery and crime against humanity it said. The opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba told Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts.,arabiya,8/21/2013,damascus,0

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syrias war. The Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through sources on the ground said fighting raged inside the air base on Sunday. It was the Syrian armys last foothold in an area otherwise controlled by Islamic State which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. In nearby Raqqa city an Islamic State stronghold there was celebratory gunfire and several mosques announced through their loudspeakers that the base had fallen to the Islamists and cheered God is greatest a witness told Reuters. IS fighters displayed the severed heads of Syrian army soldiers in the city square the witness said adding that Syrian warplanes were heard over Raqqa following the air base attack. Earlier on Sunday the Syrian air force had bombed areas around the base. Syrian state television said that after fierce battles the military was regrouping. Citing a military source it said there was a successful evacuation of the airport and that the army was continuing strikes on terrorist groups in the area which it said had suffered heavy losses. Syrian state media gave no figure for the number of people killed in the clashes. Islamic State had also trapped around 150 retreating Syrian soldiers in an area near the base and was believed to be holding them captive the Observatory said.

1926479326,Rescuers say gas dropped on Syrian town where Russian copter downed,Aug. 1 2016 Rescuers say gas dropped on Syrian town where Russian copter downed. A Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said on Tuesday a helicopter dropped containers of toxic gas overnight on a town close to where a Russian military helicopter was shot down hours earlier. The opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC) accused President Bashar al Assad of being behind the attack. Assad has denied previous accusations of using chemical weapons. A spokesman for the Syria Civil Defense said 33 people mostly women and children were affected by the gas which they suspect was chlorine in Saraqeb in rebel-held Idlib province. The group which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers posted a video on YouTube apparently showing a number of men struggling to breathe and being given oxygen masks by people in civil defense uniforms. Medium-sized barrels fell containing toxic gasses. The Syrian Civil Defense was not able to determine the type of the gas said the spokesman. The Syrian government and its Russian allies were not immediately available for comment. The SNC said in a statement: After shelling besieging and killing civilians and perpetrating war crimes on them the Assad regime has resorted once again and in breach of UN resolutions 2118 and 2235 to using chemical substances and toxic gasses. The daily reality confirms that all the international agreements and previous security council decisions be they about chemical weapons or otherwise are meaningless for the Assad regime. The Civil Defense spokesman said it was the second time Saraqeb had been hit by toxic gas. The group was aware of around nine suspected chlorine gas incidents across Idlib province since the conflict began he said. Monitors at the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence on all sides in the civil war said barrel bombs fell on Saraqeb late on Monday wounding a large number of citizens. Russias defense ministry said a Russian helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb during the day on Monday killing all five people on board in the biggest officially acknowledged loss of life for Russian forces since they started operations in Syria. Denials The helicopter came down roughly mid-way between Aleppo and Russias main air base at Khmeimim in the western province of Latakia near the Mediterranean coast. Russian air power began supporting Syrian President Bashar al Assad late last year an intervention which tipped the balance of the war in Assads favor eroding gains the rebels had made that year. The Russian defense ministry said the Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo as it made its way back to Khmeimim. No group has claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter. Government and opposition forces have both denied using chemical weapons during the five-year-old civil war. Western powers say the government has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government and Russia have accused rebels of using poison gas. UN investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack which it estimates killed 1429 people including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels. Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian government agreed to destroy the states declared stockpile of chemical weapons a process completed in January 2016. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulfur mustard commonly known as mustard gas had been used for the first time in the conflict without saying which party in the many-sided conflict it thought had used it.,arabiya,8/1/2016,idlib,0
1926479327,Blaming Assad Trump says Syria attack cannot be tolerated,Wednesday 5 April 2017 Blaming Assad Trump says Syria attack cannot be tolerated. Decrying an affront to humanity President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that a chemical weapons attack in Syria cannot be tolerated but did not say what the US might do in response. He blamed the attack squarely on Syrian President Bashar Assad. Trump speaking alongside Jordans King Abdullah II in the Rose Garden offered no details about what steps the US might take in response even as his UN ambassador Nikki Haley was promising a strong and perhaps even unilateral response. But Trump said the attack was so horrific and noted that it had killed innocent people small children and even beautiful little babies. These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated Trump said. He said the US stood with its global allies to condemn this horrific attack. The United States and Russia were trading conflicting assertions Wednesday about who launched a chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 72 people as world leaders grasped for a response to the latest atrocity in Syrias intractable civil war. President Donald Trump accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Queen Rania shakes hands with Jordans King Abdullah II in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington Wednesday April 5 2017. (AP) As Trump stood by his charge that Assads forces were responsible Russia disagreed. The staunch Assad ally insisted that the chemicals were dispersed when Syrian warplanes bombed a facility where rebels were building chemical weapons. At the United Nations Trumps envoy threatened unilateral US action if the world body failed to act. When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action Haley declared. She addressed an emergency meeting of the Security Council which was weighing a resolution condemning chemical weapons use in Syria. Russia which has veto power is opposed. Yet in Moscow Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova focused her attention elsewhere: Its necessary to demand that the rebels offer full access to study the area and collect necessary information. Leaders and officials in other countries including Britain and Israel joined the US in saying Assads forces were responsible. A US official said an American review of radar and other assessments showed Syrian aircraft flying in the area at the time of the attack. Russian and coalition aircraft were not there at that time said the official who wasnt authorized to discuss intelligence publicly and requested anonymity. Washington hasnt yet concluded what type of chemical was used. On Tuesday President Donald Trump split the blame between Syrias embattled leader and former President Barack Obama for the countrys worst chemical weapons attack in years. While calling the attack reprehensible and intolerable Trump said Obama did nothing after Assad crossed the former US leaders red line in 2013. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution Trump said. The political tone of Trumps statement took many US officials by surprise. They noted that US presidents have rarely attacked their predecessors so aggressively for events like chemical weapons attacks that Democrats and Republicans both abhor. Several officials involved in internal administration discussions said Trumps National Security Council had been preparing a different statement until the presidents closest advisers took over the process. The officials werent authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. The presidents eldest daughter and top adviser Ivanka Trump took a more compassionate tone tweeting Wednesday Heartbroken and outraged by the images coming out of Syria following the atrocious chemical attack yesterday. At least 72 people died in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The World Health Organization said victims seemed to show symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure. Videos from the scene showed volunteer medics using firehoses to wash the chemicals from victims bodies and lifeless children being piled in heaps.,arabiya,4/5/2017,idlib,1
1926479330,Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy,Saturday 15 April 2017 Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy. A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to enter Aleppo on Saturday killing at least 100 and wounding hundreds more after an evacuation deal between Syrias warring sides halted and stranded thousands at two transit points on the city outskirts. Images posted by the outlets showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and flaming vehicles belching out thick black smoke. British-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted 24 dead and dozens more wounded. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts which had been waiting to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself carrying people evacuated from two Shiite villages on Friday. The residents alongside hundreds of pro-government fighters had left the two rebel-besieged villages in northwest Idlib province under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families moved out of a government-besieged area near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at two transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya the Shiite villages were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to Idlib province which the armed opposition controls. The agreement is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua Mehdi Tahhan said. We had no choice A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around Ahmed 24 said. Were sad and angry about what has happened he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya. Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which include areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.,arabiya,4/15/2017,aleppo,0
1926479334,Syrian opposition: 1300 killed in chemical attack on Ghouta region,Wednesday 21 August 2013 Syrian opposition: 1300 killed in chemical attack on Ghouta region. At least 1300 people have been killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region leading opposition figure George Sabra said on Wednesday. In response the opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba added to Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. Meanwhile The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. Activists at the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council said regime fighter planes were flying over the area after the bombardment accusing the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical agents. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters news agency the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts. In an interview with Al Arabiya Syrian National Coalition chief Ahmad Jarba called on the U.N. investigators to travel to Ghouta the site of the massacre. Activists from the grassroots Local Coordination Committee reported at least 30 bodies had been brought to one field hospital in Kafr Batna neighborhood a few miles east of central Damascus according to Reuters. Meanwhile the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. Activists at the Local Coordinating Committees said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. Regime denial Meanwhile Syrian authorities denied charges that the army used chemical weapons in the attacks. Reports on the use of chemical weapons in (the suburbs of) Ghouta are totally false state news agency SANA said. It dismissed as unfounded the reports from opposition activists and said satellite news channels carrying the reports are implicated in the shedding of Syrian blood and support terrorism. Its an attempt to prevent the U.N. commission of inquiry from carrying out its mission the statement added. (With Reuters and AFP) ,arabiya,8/21/2013,damascus,1
1926479349,Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off?,Friday 23 August 2013 Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off? As the international community tries to wrap its head around the recent allegations of chemical weapons attack in Syria numerous unanswered questions remain on the type of agent used and the party who carried it leaving the door open on the repercussions of such an attack on the diplomatic and military levels. News of the Ghoutta Massacre have surfaced on Wednesday with the opposition accusing the Syrian government of launching a Chemical attack and killing between 1000 and 1800 people. Understanding the attack Based on videos of responders that surfaced after the attack and the nature of casualties Gwyn Winfield editor of CBRNe World a publication that specializes in unconventional weapons tells Al-Arabiya that they suggest that it might be chemical biological or radiological device. The symptoms which included shortage of breath pinpoint pupils mucus secretions that it was a chemical attack but exactly which chemical it is is difficult to decide says the expert. Verifying the kind of agent used and getting specifics on the attack would require according to Winfield a sample of the agent itself or a blood or hair sample from a victim or casualty. The least value evidence would be water or soil from the area where the rockets landed. While lot of fingers have been pinpointed in different directions after the attack with the Assad regime denying the attack altogether and the opposition implicating the government three indications are mandatory to know in order to identify the source says Winfield. They are: the agent itself the delivery system (rocket/shell/mortar and the device that fires it) and the skill needed to bring the three together (personnel). The most difficult part in this is identifying the agent as Syria has the delivery system and skill in abundance. Winfield notes that the Assad regime has stated that they have a close hold on the agent a statement that is designed to assure Western powers as much as allies that the regime has control over these weapons. But the risk of the regime losing control over such material has long been a concern of Washington and neighbors of Syria. Winfield says that all the rebels would need is overrun an ammunition dump with a small supply of agent to stage such an attack. Repercussions The concern in Washington and in many Western capitals is that regardless of who staged the attack the turn of events towards chemical weapons use in Syria or these weapons falling in the wrong hands is a red line and a major security threat. Andrew Tabler a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy tells Al-Arabiya that if the chemical weapons use is confirmed on such a massive scale it will be much harder for the Barack Obama administration not to respond warning that this might be a sign of more systematic use in the future if we are not there already. The Wall Street Journal quoting Pentagon officials said yesterday that the U.S. began refining its military options for possible strikes in Syria. In a parallel effort Secretary of State John Kerry is working the diplomatic track and has placed calls to his French Russian and Turkish counterparts to discuss potential response. Obama told CNN today that core national interests are now at stake if Chemical weapons use is verified both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating as well as needing to protect our allies our bases in the region. Tabler does not expect an immediate military action however due to the time needed to plan militarily and for diplomacy and coalition building a priority for the Obama administration. Still he warns that Washington can not afford waiting too long. But even military action in the form of airstrikes would not resolve the Chemicals weapons threat. Winfield points out that it is very difficult to protect these weapons and the chances of killing everyone that knows how to operate these systems is slim as is the chance of destroying every mortar howitzer and rocket battery. He says that destroying a chemical agent is very difficult to do safely and it would require special forces on the ground something that the U.S. has been very reluctant about doing in Syria.,arabiya,8/23/2013,damascus,0
1926479352,Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus,August 21 2013 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

1926479354,Islamic State beheads crucifies in push for Syrias east,August 11 2014 Islamic State beheads crucifies in push for Syrias east. Oliver Holmes Suleiman Al-Khalidi. Islamic State has crushed a pocket of resistance to its control in eastern Syria crucifying two people and executing 23 others in the past five days a monitoring group said on Monday. The insurgents who are also making rapid advances in Iraq are tightening their grip in Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. Fighters from the al-Sheitaat tribe in eastern Deir al-Zor had tried to resist Islamic States advance this month according to residents near the area and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring organization. In al-Shaafa a town on the banks of the Euphrates river Islamic State beheaded two men from the al-Sheitaat clan on Sunday the Observatory said and gave residents a 12-hour deadline on Monday to hand over members of the tribe. In other parts of Deir al-Zor province the militants crucified two men for the crime of dealing with apostates in the city of Mayadin and two others were beheaded for blasphemy in the nearby town of al-Bulel the Observatory said. Islamic State which has fought the Syrian army Kurdish militias and Sunni Muslim tribal forces has made rapid gains in Syria since it seized northern Iraqs largest city Mosul on June 10 and declared an Islamic caliphate. The Observatory said a further 19 men from the al-Sheitaat tribe were executed on Thursday 18 shot dead and one beheaded on the outskirts of Deir al-Zor city. It said the men worked at an oil installation. No one will now dare from the other tribes to move against Islamic State after the defeat of the al-Sheitaat said Ahmad Ziyada al-Qaissi an Islamic State sympathizer contacted by Skype from Mayadin. Tribal sources say the conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after Islamic State took over of two oil fields in July. One of those al-Omar is the biggest oil and gas field in Deir al-Zor and has been a lucrative source of funds for rebel groups. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju called in a video message for other tribes to join the fight against Islamic State. We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If (Islamic State) are done with us the other tribes will targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target he said in the video posted on YouTube on Sunday. WINNING RESPECT Damaged military vehicles that belonged to forces loyal to Syrias President Bashar al-Assad are parked at the armys 17th Division base after it was seized by fighters from the Islamic State outside Syrias northern Raqqa province August 10 2014. REUTERS/Stringer A Syrian human rights activist from Deir al-Zor who fled for Turkey last year said rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad had retreated to al-Sheitaat tribal areas from which they had been trying to mount resistance to Islamic State. He said on condition of anonymity that the resistance had been crushed in the last few days. The situation is very bad but the people cant repel them he said. He said that in tandem with their violent campaign Islamic State was distributing gas electricity fuel and food to garner local support. It is a poor area. They are winning support this way. They won a lot of support this way. They are halting theft and punishing thieves. This is also giving them credibility. Slideshow (2 Images) Another resident of Deir al-Zor Abdullah al-Noami said that four al-Sheitaat towns had fallen. These areas have fallen into the hands of Islamic State after the withdrawal of the (al-Sheitaat) fighters. The youths who were found were executed or their heads were cut off on the grounds that they fought against Islamic State he said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias civil war which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad a member of the Shiite-derived Alawite minority backed by Shiite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. In Raqqa Islamic States power base in Syria its hold appears to be growing only firmer even as Syrian government forces intensify air strikes on territory held by the group. One Syrian living in an area of Islamic State control near Raqqa said the number of its fighters in the streets had grown dramatically in the last few weeks particularly since it captured the armys 17th Division at the end of July. The group has levied a tax on non-Muslims and settled foreign fighters in confiscated homes said the resident who asked for anonymity due to security concerns. But despite that as in Deir al-Zor it has won a degree of respect among locals by curbing crime using their version law of and order.

1926479355,Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo,Tuesday 12 July 2016 Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo. Rebel fighters launched a major assault on government-held districts of Syrias long-divided Aleppo on Monday after the regime severed their only remaining supply route into the battleground city. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that began with anti-government protests in 2011 and which has since killed more than 280000 people. Rebels launched the offensive at dawn to reopen the Castello Road their last lifeline into the northern city an AFP correspondent said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 19 regime forces were killed Monday when rebels blew up a tunnel in the Old City. Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said: The opposition has not advanced because of the heavy aerial bombardment the regime is carrying out on the areas where fighting is underway. Air raids on the rebel-held parts of Aleppo killed 13 civilians Monday the Observatory said most of them in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood near the front line. An AFP journalist saw rescue workers help a stocky shirtless man out of the rubble in Bab al-Maqam his face and thick beard caked in dust. The unidentified man entered a field hospital and embraced the limp bodies of two young boys. He was martyred. Hes gone he said crying over the body of one them. Several rounds of UN-brokered talks to end the conflict have failed but the UNs special envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday that a crucial moment had been reached in efforts to secure a political settlement. But despite the diplomatic flurry fighting has intensified in Aleppo divided between government forces in the west and rebels in the east since mid-2012. Barrage of shells Rebels fired a barrage of at least 300 shells into western Aleppo killing nine civilians the Observatory said. Ahmed a resident of the government-controlled west of the city said his home in the Syria quarter was completely destroyed. The shells have rained down on the western neighborhoods since 4:30 am he told AFP. Residents lifted debris in the Syria quarter and helped neighbors gather their belongings so they could leave in search of shelter elsewhere. Mahmud Abu Malak a spokesman for the Nureddin al-Zanki rebel group described fierce fighting. All kinds of heavy artillery and machine-guns are being used in the assault which is intended to ease the pressure on the Mallah and Handarat fronts he said referring to areas near the rebel supply route into Aleppo. The Castello Road route was effectively severed last Thursday when government forces seized a hilltop within firing range. The advance leaves the opposition-held east of the city cut off and raises the prospect of total siege. On Sunday at least 29 opposition fighters were killed when rebels launched a fruitless assault to push government forces back from the road and reopen the route. Watch: Regional international diplomats struggle over Aleppo Play Video Meagre food stocks The severing of the Castello Road has already created shortages of food and fuel in the east of Aleppo with local market stalls sparsely stocked. There are very few vegetables today because the Castello Road is closed said Abu Mohamed a vendor in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. If we hadnt planted eggplant and zucchini inside the city we wouldnt have had any vegetables at all he said pointing to his meagre stock of vegetables. Residents also described searching in vain for fuel whether for vehicles or home use. The UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas of the country most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the tactic. The latest violence comes despite an extension until early Tuesday of a nationwide truce declared last week by the government to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. In northwest Idlib province 17 people including two children were killed in air strikes which the Observatory said were carried out by either regime or allied Russian warplanes. US Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Moscow this week to seek common ground on how to deal with the ongoing bloodshed it was announced Monday. The current truce does not cover extremists from ISIS or the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. Also Monday ISIS militants entered the historic city of Palmyra in central Syria for the first time since being defeated there by regime forces in March. But they were killed and the attack was now over according to the Observatory. ISIS fighters also claimed a suicide attack on a rival rebel group in the town of Dumeir east of Damascus on Sunday that killed 16 people.

1926479363,Assad regime responsible for awful Syria chemical attack: EUs Mogherini,Tuesday 4 April 2017 Assad regime responsible for awful Syria chemical attack: EUs Mogherini . EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said Tuesday the regime of Bashar al-Assad bears primary responsibility for a suspected chemical attack that killed at least 58 people in a rebel-held town in Idlib Syria including 11 children under the age of eight on Tuesday. Today the news is awful Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war-monitoring group. This morning at 6:30 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tay yip Eroding and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. US air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where militias have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of US-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that ISIS used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a US-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.,arabiya,4/4/2017,idlib,1
1926479371,Rebel-held zone of Syrias Aleppo braces for renewed bombardment,November 4 2016 Rebel-held zone of Syrias Aleppo braces for renewed bombardment. Ellen Francis Angus McDowall. Syrian rebels and civilians showed no sign of leaving the besieged opposition-held sector of Aleppo on Friday despite a Russian deadline to resume bombing Syrias largest city at nightfall after a 17-day pause. The rebels own shelling of residential parts of government-held western Aleppo has meanwhile killed dozens in the past week as insurgent groups staged a counter-attack from outside the city aimed at breaking the siege on areas they control. The government sent ambulances and buses to bring people out of the besieged zone as it has done at other times during the pause but there was still no sign that anybody would leave. Residents contacted by Reuters seemed resigned to the resumption in bombing which killed hundreds of people in late September and early October as the government and its Russian allies abandoned a ceasefire to launch their assault on the biggest urban area in opposition hands. Nothing can be done. Nobody can stop the planes said Bebars Mishal an official with the white helmets civil defense volunteer group in eastern Aleppo which digs victims out of the rubble and runs an ambulance service. He said there was no way for rescue workers or medical staff to prepare in advance of the expected resumption of attacks: All we can do is take precautions and be ready 24 hours a day. Moscow and Damascus say their pause in bombing the city will end at 7 pm (1700 GMT) accusing rebels of having used the pause to reinforce and launch attacks on government-held areas. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that by around 8:30 pm local time there was no sign yet of resumed aerial bombardment of central parts of the city. The government and its Russian allies say they target only militants and that fighters are to blame for civilian casualties by operating in civilian areas. Western countries say the bombing has deliberately targeted hospitals aid workers and bakeries and Washington has accused Moscow of war crimes. Rebels say the aim is to drive out civilians some 275000 of whom remain in the besieged zone. They call it a ceasefire. The regime hasnt let us hear the end of it said Modar Shekho a nurse in rebel-held eastern Aleppo. As usual when it ends they will let the bombardment loose. Weve gotten used to this. Syrias army backed by Lebanese Iranian and Iraqi Shiite militias and Russias air force launched a major offensive to retake eastern Aleppo from rebel groups on Sept. 22 after a series of advances allowed them to besiege it this summer. Aleppo has become the focal point of fighting in Syrias war now in its sixth year pitting President Bashar al-Assad and his allies against Sunni rebel groups including some supported by Turkey Gulf Arab monarchies and the United States. The city has been divided between the government-held western sector and rebel-held east for years. Winning full control of it would be the biggest victory so far for Assads government in a war that has killed many hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than half of Syrians from their homes. NOBODY WILL LEAVE Damascus and Moscow declared a unilateral four-day pause in strikes on Oct. 18 promising rebels and residents safe passage to leave the city and have extended it for most days since although some attacks have continued. Russia which has brought an additional aircraft carrier to Syrias coast said on Wednesday that all rebels must leave Aleppo by Friday evening adding its moratorium on air strikes could not be extended because of rebel shelling. A witness in western Aleppo at Bustan al-Qasr near a crossing point set up by the government to allow civilians to flee the rebel area told Reuters on Friday he could see people waiting for relatives to come from the east. Buses and ambulances were waiting for them but so far there was no sign of an exodus. A woman at Bustan al-Qasr who was covering her face said she hoped the people in eastern Aleppo would be able to leave safely and peacefully. Rebels have rejected the demand they withdraw. Nobody will leave and the Russians will escalate. The Russians declared this said Zakaria Malahifji a Turkey-based official from the politburo of the Fastaqim group which is present in Aleppo. The opposition says Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies aim to win the war by depopulating rebel-held areas starving the population out or bombing them into flight. The Russians are adopting a policy of demographic change with the regime and Iran and their intentions are no longer hidden an official from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki rebel group said. In recent months other opposition-held areas have surrendered after long army sieges. The government calls the process reconciliation offering safe passage out for rebel fighters who abandon territory and lay down their arms. It has proposed a similar program to end the siege of eastern Aleppo opening what the army calls safe corridors and sending ambulances for injured civilians and green city buses to transport fighters to Idlib a rebel-held area. But so far only a very small number of people have left the rebel-held zone since late October. Damascus has accused rebels of stopping people from leaving including by shelling the safe corridors which rebels have denied. I wish civilians would exit ... but I expect that wont happen not under these circumstances Fadi Ismail an official based in Aleppo in Syrias reconciliation ministry told Reuters via telephone. Ismail said prospects for a deal with rebels looked bleak. There must be military action of course he said if no one evacuated. The United Nations has said it does not have security guarantees needed to deliver aid into eastern Aleppo. It opposes evacuations of civilians from besieged areas unless they are voluntary. After their offensive began in late September pro-government forces managed to take ground in northern Aleppo including a camp for Palestinian refugees and smaller areas in the south but made fewer advances into densely populated areas. Rebels launched a counter-attack a week ago against the western edge of government-held areas from the surrounding countryside. They have made progress in the Dahiyet al-Assad suburb and the 1070 apartment blocks district using 15 suicide car bomb attacks during the week a war monitor said. The Observatory said the rebels had killed 69 civilians including 25 children in shelling during their counter-attack.

1926479378,Syrian Russian jets pound rebel areas,Wednesday 16 November 2016 Syrian Russian jets pound rebel areas. Air strikes pounded neighbourhoods around a childrens hospital and a blood bank in rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Wednesday in a second day of renewed bombing that has killed at least 32 people a war monitor medics and emergency workers said. Russian military planes were seen all night until morning in several regions of Idlib in northwestern Syria said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The regime air force bombed eastern sectors of Aleppo Syrias divided second city Abdel Rahman told AFP. The air raids formed part of a wider military escalation by the Syrian government and allies including Russia which fired coordinated volleys of missiles at rebels on Tuesday and for the first time used its only aircraft carrier. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes on eastern Aleppo on Wednesday alone killed at least 21 people including five children and an emergency worker. They were carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes it said. The Observatory said districts struck included al-Shaar al-Sukkari al-Sakhour and Karam al-Beik. Air raids also continued in the countryside west of Aleppo from which rebels have launched assaults on government-held areas. An attack on the village of Batbo killed at least 19 people including three children the Observatory said. Moscow has denied reports that its jets have hit Aleppo in the renewed wave of bombardment and said it was sticking to a moratorium on air strikes in the city. Tuesdays bombing run on eastern Aleppo appeared to mark the end of a pause inside the city declared by Russia on Oct. 18 which Syrias military had also largely observed. The Observatory and residents said the citys east was hit by rocket fired from jets barrel bombs dropped from helicopters and artillery from government forces. The helicopters wont stop for a single moment Bebars Mishal a civil defence worker in rebel-held Aleppo told Reuters. Right now the bombing wont let up. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke of a major operation which saw the first missions carried out by warplanes taking off from the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier that arrived off Syria last week. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a moratorium on Russian air strikes against targets in Aleppo remained in place for the time being.

Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that has killed more than 300000 people across the country since it started in March 2011 with anti-government protests. UN condemns Syrian attacks in Aleppo Meanwhile a UN committee has approved a resolution strongly condemning the recent escalation of attacks in Aleppo and continuing violence by the Syrian government against its own people. The General Assemblys human rights committee voted 116-15 with 49 abstentions in favor of the draft resolution on Tuesday. It is virtually certain to be adopted when the assembly votes next month. An injured child waits after receiving treatment at the University hospital in a government-held neighbourhood on November 3 2016 following reported rebel fire on government-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo. (AFP) The draft resolution demands that Syrian authorities immediately put an end to all indiscriminate attacks including those involving the use of terror tactics air strikes barrel and vacuum bombs incendiary weapons chemical weapons and heavy artillery. It deplores and condemns in the strongest terms widespread human rights violations by the Syrian government. The draft calls for a cease-fire by all parties saying this is essential to achieve a political solution. Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added. The World Food Programme is distributing rations to more than 4 million people in Syria each month.

1926479384,U.N. chief pushes Syria to allow for chemical attack probe,Friday 23 August 2013 U.N. chief pushes Syria to allow for chemical attack probe. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday renewed his push for Syria to allow U.N. inspectors immediate access to investigate allegations that the government carried out a deadly chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. I can think of no good reason why any party either government or opposition forces - would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter the U.N. chief told a diplomatic forum in Seoul. Syrias government has offered no public response to U.N. calls for its team to inspect the site of the attack which opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said killed from 500 to well over 1000 people. They said more bodies were being found in the wake of Wednesdays mysterious pre-dawn killer fumes which the Syrian government insists were not its doing. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama said it was appalled by the death reports. A U.S. official familiar with initial intelligence assessments said the attack appeared to be the work of the Assad government. It was the regime acting as a regime the official said. But the Obama administration made clear that any response would await confirmation of a chemical attack and its origin. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies laid out on floors with no visible signs of injury. Some had foam at the nose and mouth. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said world powers must respond with force if allegations that Syrias government was responsible for the deadliest chemical attack on civilians in a quarter-century prove true. But Fabius stressed there was no question of sending in troops on the ground. Talk of a forceful foreign response remains unlikely to be translated into rapid concerted action given division between the West and Russia at Wednesdays U.N. Security Council meeting and caution from Washington on Thursday. Moscow has said rebels may have released gas to discredit Assad and urged him to agree to a U.N. inspection. On Wednesday Russian objections to Western pressure on Syria saw the Security Council merely call in vague terms for clarity - a position increasingly frustrated Syrian rebels described as shameful. The State Department said senior U.S. and Russian diplomats would meet in The Hague next Wednesday to discuss ending Syrias civil war in what would be the first such meeting since allegations of the chemical attack. A senior State Department official said chemical weapons would also be discussed at the meeting. The meeting had previously been announced but no date had been released. Ban said he would send a top U.N. disarmament official Angela Kane to lobby the Syrian government in person and expected a swift positive answer. Obama has directed U.S. intelligence agencies to urgently help establish what caused the deaths a State Department spokeswoman said while acknowledging it may be difficult given that the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Syria. At this time right now we are unable to conclusively determine CW (chemical weapons) use the State Departments Jen Psaki told reporters. We are doing everything possible in our power to nail down the facts she added. Another U.S. official said intelligence agencies were not given a deadline and would take the time needed to reach a conclusion with confidence. Former weapons investigators say every hour matters. The longer it takes the easier it is for anybody who has used it to try to cover up said Demetrius Perricos who headed the U.N. team of weapons inspectors in Iraq in the 2000s. People are growing desperate Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. Syrian officials have called allegations against their forces illogical and fabricated. They point to the timing of the attack days after U.N. inspectors arrived after months of argument and to previous assurances that if they possessed chemical weapons they would never use them against Syrians. After months of negotiating with Assads government to let inspectors into Syria a U.N. team arrived in Damascus four days ago. Their task is to check on the presence but not the sources of chemical weapons that are alleged to have been released in three specific small incidents several months ago. Many rebels and activists in the opposition area say they have lost interest in promises of U.N. investigations or in help from abroad: We are 7 km away just a five-minute car ride from where they are staying said activist Bara Abdelrahman. Were being exterminated with poison gas while they drink their coffee and sit inside their hotels. Qassem Saadeddine a commander and spokesman for the rebels Supreme Military Council said the group was still deliberating on how or if it should respond: People are growing desperate as they watch another round of political statements and U.N. meetings without any hope of action he told Reuters. Syrias revolt against four decades of Assad family rule has turned into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 100000people in 2-1/2 years and divided the Middle East along largely sectarian lines. Among world powers the conflict has revived Cold War-era East-West tensions and on the ground the struggle has limped to a poisonous stalemate. Assads Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam and has the backing of Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Western powers back the opposition but have been reluctant to fully commit to an Arab Sunni-backed revolt increasing layover taken by Islamists linked to al Qaeda. Yet they have said the large-scale use of widely banned chemical weapons would be a game changer. Syrias southern neighbor Israel still technically at war with Damascus said it believed Syrian forces had used chemical weapons and accused the world of turning a blind eye: The world condemns the world investigates the world pays lip service Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said. In Paris Fabius said that if the Security Council could not make a decision one would have to be taken in other ways but he did not elaborate. Immediate international action is likely to be limited. European officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that options ranging from air strikes creating a no-fly zone or providing heavy weapons to some rebels were all still on the table - but that there was little prospect of concrete measures without U.S. backing which still seemed unlikely. The American reaction following yesterdays attack wascautious said one official. And without U.S. firepower theres little we can do.

1926479389,Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets,August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

1962495633,Car bomb kills four in Damascus,Thu Sep 5 2013 Car bomb kills four in Damascus. A car bomb has killed four people in the Sumaria area in the Syrian capital Damascus as citizens are bracing for a possible US attack the official Syrian news agency has reported. According to SANA the car bomb caused big flames and damaged surrounding buildings. Four people were killed and 6 were wounded in the attack which happened near the Research and Tests Center affiliated to the Syrian Ministry of Industry. Damascus residents already accustomed to incessant warfare within the Syrian capital were making final preparations this weekend for an attack from outside attempting to anticipate where American missiles might strike. Tensions rose higher in the region after US rushed to dispatch its warships toward Syria threatening to bomb several areas in the country based on conflicting reports of an alleged chemical attack in the country. The US-backed militants posted pictures and videos of an alleged chemical attack which they claimed the Syrian army was responsible for it. The Syrian government which has already called for UN action against several cases of chemical attacks by anti-Syria militants in the country rejected the claims as baseless and paved the way for visiting UN team of inspectors to investigate the story. Syria says the attack was actually carried out by the foreign-backed militants to open way for their Western and regional supporters to attack Syria. Despite killing of at least 100000 people in the massive insurgency in Syria the US had said that it would enter the conflict if a chemical attack was carried out.,alalam,2/2/2011,damascus,0

Rebels and local residents in Syrias Ghouta say Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan provided chemical weapons to an al-Qaeda-linked armed group. Interviews with people in Damascus and Ghouta a suburb of the Syrian capital where the humanitarian agency Doctors Without Borders said at least 355 people had died last week from what it believed to be a neurotoxic agent indicated the Saudi-backed militants could be responsible for the recent deadly chemical attack in Syria. The US has been moving its warships closer to Syria russhing to bomb army and government bases based on conflicting reports over an alleged chemical attack in Ghouta near capital Damascus. However from numerous interviews with doctors Ghouta residents militant fighters and their families a different picture emerges the Mint Press News reported. Many of the residents believe that certain militants received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan and were responsible for carrying out the gchemical attack. My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry said Abu Abdel-Moneim the father of a militant fighting to unseat the Syrian government who lives in Ghouta. Abdel-Moneim said his son and 12 other militants were killed inside of a tunnel used to store weapons provided by a Saudi militant known as Abu Ayesha who was leading a fighting battalion. The father described the weapons as having a tube-like structure while others were like a huge gas bottle. Ghouta townspeople said the militants were using mosques and private houses to sleep while storing their weapons in tunnels. Abdel-Moneim said his son and the others died during the chemical weapons attack. That same day the terrorist Jabhat al-Nusra which is linked to al-Qaeda announced that it would similarly attack civilians in the Syrian government heartland of Latakia on its western coast in purported retaliation. It tell us what these arms were or how to use them complained a female fighter named We didnt know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons.When Saudi Prince Bandar gives such weapons to people he must give them to those who know how to handle and use them she warned. She like other Syrians does not want to use their full names for fear of retribution. A well-known militant leader in Ghouta named agreed. Jabhat al-Nusra militants do not cooperate with other militants except with fighting on the ground. They do not share secret information. They merely used some ordinary militants to carry and operate this material he said. We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions said. Doctors who treated the chemical weapons attack victims cautioned interviewers to be careful about asking questions regarding who was responsible for the deadly assault. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders added that health workers aiding 3600 patients also reported experiencing similar symptoms including frothing at the mouth respiratory distress convulsions and blurry vision. The group has not been able to independently verify the information. More than a dozen militants interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government. ,alalam,8/31/2013,damascus,0

The Turkish military has repeatedly targeted northern Syria with artillery shells guided missiles and mortars to hit militants who Ankara says have fired rockets at southern Turkish border towns. There have also been reports of operations by Turkeys Special Forces inside the Syrian territory. Turkey has also hinted at establishing a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (60-mile) stretch between Manbij in Aleppo Province and the Turkish border prompting objections from Iran and Russia. The US has supported the plan describing it as part of a deepening campaign by the Turkish army to push ISIS away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the groups main lifeline. Turkey and the US however do not see eye to eye on Washingtons support for Kurdish militants in northern Syria.

Army sources in Syria said on Sunday that the US pounded several strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor in the last few days to prevent the army and its allies further advances in the fight against the ISIL terrorists. ""The US aimed to extend the geographical area of its influence by bombing the strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor and stop the Syrian armys advance in the war against the ISIL"" the source told FNA.

1965495324,Syria Accuses Rebels of Using Chemical Weapons,"24.08.2013 Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" DAMASCUS Syria (The Associated Press Albert Aji) Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs gas masks vials of an unspecified medication explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts. It did not however show any video of soldiers reportedly affected by toxic gas in the fighting in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus. Still the claims could muddy the debate about who was responsible for an alleged gas attack on rebel-held suburbs of the capital on Wednesday that activists say killed more than 130 people. That attack has spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international military action if chemical weapons were indeed used. Just hours before the state media reports the UN disarmament chief arrived in Damascus to press President Bashar Assads regime to allow UN experts to investigate Wednesdays alleged attack. The Assad regime has denied allegations that it was behind that attack calling them ""absolutely baseless"" and suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government. The US Britain France and Russia have urged the Assad regime and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to cooperate with the United Nations and allow a team of experts already in Syria to look into the latest purported use of chemical agents. The UN secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane the high representative for disarmament affairs to push for a speedy investigation into Wednesdays purported attack. She did not speak to reporters upon her arrival in Damascus Saturday. With the pressure increasing on the regime to comply Syrias state media alleged on Saturday that rebels in the contested district of Jobar had used chemical weapons against government troops advancing into the area. The state news agency said several government troops who took part in an offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even ""suffocation"" after ""armed terrorist groups used chemical weapons."" It was not clear what was meant by ""suffocation"" and the report mentioned no fatalities among the troops. The government refers to rebels fighting to topple Assad as ""terrorists."" ""The Syrian Army achieved major progress in the past days and for that reason the terrorist groups used chemical weapons as their last card"" the Syrian state TV said. That report was followed by an unusual string of breaking alerts on the TVs news scroll that made a series of claims related to the alleged use of chemical arms by rebels in the Jobar neighborhood. One message cited a Syrian TV journalist who is embedded with the troops in the district who said the army confiscated an arms cache that included gas masks and several barrels with ""made in Saudi Arabia"" stamped on them. It did not say what was in the barrels but appeared to suggest that some sort of chemical agent was inside and supplied by Saudi Arabia the regions Sunni Muslim power and a staunch supporter of Syrias Sunni-led revolt. Another news scroll said that troops after overrunning rebel positions discovered antidotes following exposure to chemical agents. The TV said the medicines were produced by a Qatari-German medical supplies company. Qatar is another strong supporter of the Syrian rebels. The report could not be immediately verified. For days the government has been trying to counter rebel allegations that the regime used chemical weapons on civilians in rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus arguing that opposition fighters themselves were responsible for that attack. On Saturday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said dismissed the government line. ""All the information we have is converging to indicate there was a chemical massacre in Syria near Damascus and that Bashar Assads regime was behind it"" Fabius told reporters during a visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah. He did not elaborate. France has suggested that force could be used against Syria if Assads regime was proven to have used chemical arms. The new talk of potential military action in Syria has made an independent investigation by UN inspectors critical to determine what exactly transpired. The UN experts already in Syria are tasked with investigating three earlier purported chemical attacks in the country one in the village of Khan al-Assal outside the northern city of Aleppo in March as well as two other locations that have been kept secret for security reasons. It took months of negotiations between the UN and Damascus before an agreement was struck to allow the 20-member team into Syria to investigate. Its mandate is limited to those three sites however and it is only charged with determining whether chemical weapons were used not who used them. Syrias Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil told The Associated Press on Thursday that he was personally in favor of a fair transparent international delegation to investigate the latest incident. But he said that would require a new agreement between the government and the United Nations and that the conditions for such a delegation would need to be studied. ... 11 Tags Bashar al-Assad chemical weapons Angela Kane Damascus Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News",sputnik,8/24/2013,damascus,0

BEIRUT August 21 (The Associated Press) Syrian regime forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Wednesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a ""poisonous gas"" attack that killed dozens of people. The claims came as a 20-member UN chemical weapons team was in Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks had allegedly occurred in the past. The Syrian government promptly denied the reports of Wednesdays chemical weapons attack as baseless. ""They are an attempt by to divert the UN commission on chemical weapons from carrying out its mission"" the state-run SANA news agency said quoting an unnamed government official as is its standard practice. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the shelling was intense and hit the capitals eastern suburbs of Zamalka Arbeen and Ein Tarma. It quoted activists as saying that regime forces fired ""rockets with poisonous gas heads"" in the attack that killed ""tens of people."" Rami Abdul-Rahman the Observatory chief said the activists in the area said ""poisonous gas"" was fired in rockets as well as from the air. He added that regime forces were on a wide offensive on the eastern and western rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Another group the Local Coordination Committees said hundreds of people were killed or injured in the shelling. Such different figures from activists groups are common in the immediate aftermaths of attacks in Syria where the government restricts foreign and domestic reporting. Abdul-Rahman said more than 40 people have been confirmed dead and that the death toll could reach as many as 200 in the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government has long denied claims by the opposition on chemical weapons use saying rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assads government have used such weapons. Following Wednesdays reports the Observatory called upon the UN team in Syria and all international organizations ""to visit the stricken areas and to guarantee that medical and relief supplies reach the people as soon as possible."" It also called for an investigation into the attack. Mohammed Saeed an activist in the area told The Associated Press via Skype that hundreds of dead and injured people were rushed to six makeshift hospitals in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. ""This is a massacre by chemical weapons"" said Saeed. ""The visit by the UN team is a joke ... Bashar is using the weapons and telling the world that he does not care."" The UN team led by Swedish expert Ake Sellstrom is meant to probe three sites the village of Khan al-Assal just west of the embattled northern city of Aleppo and two other locations which are being kept secret for security reasons. Wednesdays claim of the chemical attack if confirmed would be the most serious report since the March 19 claim of the attack in Khan al-Assal when at least 30 people were reported killed. Assads regime and the rebels have blamed each other for that attack. The unrest in Syria began in March 2011 and later escalated into a civil war. More than 100000 people have been killed in the conflict so far according to the United Nations.

The civilians were massacred in reprisal for collaborating with the government of Bashar al-Assad. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the killings occurred over a 20 day period. The Syrian army retook the city in April 2016 after eight months of Daesh occupation. However Daesh chased the government forces out on October 1 but the Syrian army regrouped and returned three weeks later recapturing the city once more with support from Russian airstrikes. But in that three-week period Daesh executed 128 residents of the town which had a population of about 18000 before the civil war started. The Palmyra Coordination Committee a local group that supports protest and resistance against the Syrian government reported that at least 35 of the slain were found with their bodies dumped in a mine shaft. Sputnik Hikmet Durgun US-Led Coalition Confirms Syrias Raqqa Completely Liberated From Daesh ""After the regime retook it [on Saturday] the towns residents found the bodies on the streets.

They are from the town know the towns residents and who is for or against the regime"" he added. The more human rights groups and government forces search the more corpses they discover. Of the Daesh executioners one resident of the town told the Associated Press ""These are people who dont know God they dont know anything. They killed children and women with knives they beat women broke their arms."" SOHR added that at least 12 residents of the town were killed by government forces after they regained control of Al-Qaryatayn.

Many of the towns Catholic and Orthodox Christian minorities have been abducted or killed or have fled the area reducing the Christian population from 2000 to a few hundred.

Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in US air strikes on the stronghold of the Takfiri group ISIL (so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Raqa were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Raqa. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqa."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Raqa the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents. Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei had repeatedly accused the US of backing the Takfiris saying that Washington is not honest in fighting ISIL. ",manar,7/5/2015,raqqa,1
